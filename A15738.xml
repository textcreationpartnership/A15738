            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>beeing penned by holy men, as they were mooued by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> muſt needs be in euery part, of like authority, and certainty. For what difference, in theſe points can there be reaſonably imagined, where one and the ſame Authour, God himſelfe, giueth immediately both warrant to write, and direction in writing? Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that the maine matter of both, and the chiefe end of the Lord, in both is all one; namely, the knowledge of our Redemption, by the ſacrifice of the promiſed Meſſiah Ieſus Chriſt. Onely herein doth the later ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the former, that it <note n="b" place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 19</note> deliuereth this great myſterie of Reconciliation, more particularly, and more cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In this reſpect is <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 11. 11</note> the office of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt preferd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21009:4"/> before the calling of all the Prophets, that went before him, &amp; yet made inferior to the miniſtery of the Goſpel, that was to follow him. <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>more then a Prophet;</hi> yet <hi>he, that is leaſt in the kingdom of Heauen, is greater then he.</hi> Then are we vtterly without excuſe, if the meaſure of our knowledge, in the doctrine of our euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, be not anſwerable, in ſome proportion, to the meanes thereof, in this cleere light of teaching. Let vs therefore I beſeech you, with reuerence and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſtirre vp both our ſoules, and bodies, to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that, which doth ſo neerely concerne vs, and is ſo plainly, &amp; plentifully manifeſted by our Sauiour, &amp; his Apoſtles, in theſe books of the new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Of which (that I may, in this entrance to my labor, ſay ſomewhat of them all in generall) ſome are hiſtoricall, ſome doctrinall. The hiſtoricall books declare matters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of fact, the ſayings, and doings of God, angells, and men: Some of them report of things paſt, which is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> proper office of an hiſtory. And of this kind are the fiue firſt books, the fowre Goſpels, containing the diſcourſe of our Sauiour Chriſts life, death, reſurrection, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion; one booke of the Acts, or doings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the other hiſtoricall book is the Reuelation; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by way of prophecie, concerning things to come, the eſtate of the Church of Chriſt, till the ende of the world, is moſt truely &amp; wonderfully deſcribed. Thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> treatiſes of the new Teſtament, which I call doctrinall, are ſuch as were written by the Apoſtles, for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of God; commonly called Epiſtles, becauſe they were ſent: ſent I ſay to them, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready receiued, and profeſſed the Goſpell. But of theſe I ſhal ſay more, if it pleaſe God, in my expoſition of the Epiſtle to the Romans.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now, as for thoſe bookes, which we call <hi>the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells,</hi> we are to vnderſtand, that the generall matter of them all fowre, is an hiſtory <hi>of thoſe things, that Ieſus did,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:21009:4"/> 
               <hi>and taught,</hi> while hee continued here in the world; as it is euident by <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 1. 1</note> S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and this our <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 30. &amp; 21. 25</note> Euangeliſt. But whereas they name (expreſly) no more, but his ſayings, and doings; we muſt knowe, that his ſufferings, or the things that befell him in this life, are alſo compriſed in them, according to the courſe of an hiſtorie. What is more common in the books of kings, then ſuch ſpeeches as theſe: <note n="f" place="margin">1. King, 14. 19</note> 
               <hi>Ieroboams</hi> acts; <note n="g" place="margin">29.</note> 
               <hi>Rehoboams</hi> acts; <note n="h" place="margin">&amp; 15. 31</note> 
               <hi>The reſidue of the acts of</hi> Nadab, <hi>and all that he did, are they not written in the bookes of the Chronicles of the kings of Iſraell?</hi> Yet, who is ignorant, that theſe hiſtories containe alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their deedes, a rehearſall, as of other matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, ſo namely of their death, either naturall, or violent?</p>
            <p n="2">2 But let vs come neerer to this our Euangeliſt; Firſt to the title of the book, then to the hiſtorie it ſelf.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21009:5"/> and haue changed <hi>Euangelie</hi> into Goſpell. And yet they haue not made this alteration in the Titles, (where they keepe the Latine altogether) but in thoſe parcells which were ſhared out for the ſeruice of ſome ſpeciall daies; &amp; in <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 4. 23. &amp; 26. 14 Marke, 1. 1. &amp; 14. 9</note> the text it ſelf, where the Greek word is vſed by the Euangeliſt. The word then, both in the Originall, and in our engliſh, giueth vs to vnderſtand, that the matter of theſe Hiſtories, or bookes called Goſpells, is a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ioy, and gladneſſe; yea, of ſuchioy, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as neither eye hath ſeene, care hath heard, nor the heart of man is able worthily to conceiue.</p>

At the leaſt, let this dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and deadneſſe work ſo much with vs, as to make vs ſee, how vnworthy we are of ſo vnſpeakeable loue, how vnwilling to receiue the gracious meanes of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prouided for vs, and offred to vs, yea thruſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs by the Lord, that will not ſuffer vs to periſh.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21009:6"/> it poſſible wee ſhould be ſo vnthankfull to God, ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to our ſelues, ſo iniurious to our poſterity, as to neglect driue away from vs, and them, the onely meanes of our, and their euerlaſting ſaluation? Do you thinke thoſe reprobate ſpirits the Diuells, if the Lord had vouchſafed them ſo great a mercie, would ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratelie haue reſuſed it, or ſo faintlie accepted of it?</p>
            <p>Say not to mee, you are contented to bee ſaued by Ieſus Chriſt; when you ſhew your ſelues ſo retchleſs, &amp; backeward to learne how you may bee ſaued by him. Giue mee leaue to reaſon a little with you. If an eſtate in ſome temporall poſſeſſion were beſtowed on you, by waie of Legacie, woulde you ſatisfie your ſelues; or woulde it ſerue the turne, for you to profeſſe, that you accepted of the gifte: woulde you ſtay at home, and waite till the Executours ſhould drawe you out, to goe take poſſeſſion? No, no, you would ſeeke from one Court to another, make all the friends you could, beſtowe your paines, time and charges, to haue liuery and ſeiſin of a fraile and vncertaine in heritance. But in this bountifull, and large graunt of intereſt to heauen, we haue not ſo much care, as to knowe what clayme, or title, wee haue to it. And yet it is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: <note n="g" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16</note> 
               <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſſe;</hi>

To which purpoſe I haue eſpecially made choice of this piece of Scripture. If any man pretende the hardneſſe of the matter; what is more eaſie, or more pleaſant then a ſtory? If any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21009:6"/> man deſpiſe the plaineneſſe of it, as a thing not worth his labour, becauſe a ſtorie; what is more ſtrange, or myſticall then ſuch a Storie? The Goſpell is the eaſieſt part of the Newe Teſtament. But the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> is the hardeſt part of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts writings: yea, I dare boldelie ſaie it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſure I ſhall ſpeake it truely, there is no one part of all the Scripture, (ſetting allegories, and prophecies not fulfilled, apart) that conteines mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more needefull, or more hard to be knowen, then this preſent Goſpell, or meſſage of ioyfull tydings, brought to vs by the holy Euangeliſt, the beloued Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Of whome that I may ſpeake a little, for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inciting of vs to hearken diligently to that hee writes; firſt I will entreat of his perſon, then of his writing. That which <note n="k" place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 20. 21</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth of the olde Teſtament, that <hi>no prophecie of the Scripture is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuate interpretation,</hi> but that <hi>holy men of God ſpake, as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> is alſo to bee applied to the writings of the newe Teſtament, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ſame ſpirit of God, by the like inſpiring, and directing; as it is confeſſed by all, both Proteſtants, and Papiſts, that make any profeſſion of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>For the Apoſtles of our Sauiour Chriſt, were the Penners of all theſe books ſaue <note n="l" place="margin">The Goſpells of S Marke, and S. Luke, and the Acts.</note> three: and <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13</note> to them the holy Ghoſt was both promiſed by him, to leade them into all truth, and <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 2. 3. 4</note> accordingly ſent; ſo that there can be no queſtion, but the new Teſtament, as well as the olde, is the certaine truth of God, equall in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuperior in plainneſſe, &amp; knowledge of particulars belonging to euerlaſting ſaluation.</p>
            <p>But you wil demand perhaps, how we may be aſſured, that the Apoſtles were the immediate Authors of theſe books. Firſt, we haue the ſame proof of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21009:7"/> that wee haue of the Olde, the ioynt conſent of Chriſtians, in all ages from time to time. Secondly, who ſeeth not the admirable prouidence of God in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theſe bookes in ſuch glorious reputation, maugre the power &amp; malice of the mighty ones of this world, &amp; their great maſter, Satan? Thirdly, who can be ſo ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as to deny or ſuſpect the credit of thoſe auncient Chriſtians, who, liuing in the Apoſtles times, might &amp; did certainely knowe, either by <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 6. 11 Col. 4. 18. 2. Theſ. 3. 17 1. Cor 16. 21</note> the hand, or by ſome marks, which the Apoſtles vſed (as it were ſigning and ſealing) or by enquirie of the Apoſtles themſelues, that thoſe bookes were indeed of their writing? From them this knowledge came to their next ſucceſſors, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely to vs, that now liue, by ſuch a generall conſent of ſo many thouſands in all ages, that it were more then impudencie to make queſtion of the matter; howſoeuer our Papiſts, in theſe dayes, to make all men depende on them (that they may ſhew themſelues to be Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) will haue the aſſurance of this point, as of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters of faith, to be fetcht from them that now liue, from the authority of the Church of Rome, that now is. I may ſay the like of thoſe other 3. Bookes, the Goſpels of <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; which were acknowledged by the firſt Chriſtians to thaue been endited by the ſpirit of God, and (as <note n="p" place="margin">Auguſt. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. in Ioan.</note> it is recorded by ſome) to haue beene approued for ſuch by the Apoſtle S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> who doubtleſſe, liuing till after the deceaſe of all them, that are ſaide, and belieued to be the writers of theſe, and the other books of the new Teſtament, would haue diſclaim'd the authority of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; informed the Church againſt them, if he had not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowen, that they were al the holy Ghoſts owne enditing.</p>
            <p>But it is not my purpoſe, nor is it neceſſarie to that I haue in hand, to diſpute this queſtion: onely it ſeemed to me not amiſſe to ſpeake thus much, in this entrance,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21009:7"/> as it were by the way, to preuent ſuch obiections, as might perhaps diſquiet the mindes of ſome, not ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſetled. For whoſe better ſatisfaction, I will add that, which is of moſt importance: namely, the matter conteined in theſe books; which is apparantly ſuch, for the ſubſtance of it, as the heart, and head of man were neuer able to deuiſe: yea ſuch (witneſſe <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 9. 10</note> the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint <hi>Paul) as neither ey hath ſeene, eare hath heard, nor euer came into any mans heart; But God hath reueiled it to vs, by his Spirit, which ſearcheth all things, yea the deepe things of God.</hi> This ſtrangeneſſe of the matter is ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them, that beleeue to ſaluation, by an vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, and comfort in their ſoules, conceiued vpon a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the pardon of their ſins, and a certaine hope of euerlaſting happineſſe in the life to come. In the laſt place comes the teſtimony of the ſpirit of God: which (as it were the broade ſeale) makes vp the aſſurance both of the matter, and the bookes: in which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed.</p>
            <p>If you aske me how I can diſcern the witneſſe of the Spirit, from the illuſion of Satan, and the imagination of mine owne brain, giue me leaue alſo to demand a like queſtion of you; How could the Prophets (whoſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery it pleaſed the holy Ghoſt to vſe) from time to time make a difference, betwixt the motions of the Lord himſelfe, and the ſuggeſtions you mention? were they any more able to expreſs this power of diſcerning, then the faithfull now are? I grant they could make proofe of their calling, and the reuelations they had, by a miraculous foretelling of things to come. But neither were thoſe propheſies any certaine proofes, till the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent confirmed the truth of them, and my queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ſtill vnanſwered; <hi>How they could diſcerne, that the things which they prophecied of, were reuealed to them by God, and not ſuggeſted by any deceitfull working of the diuel.</hi> Beare with mee I beſeech you, if I a little forget my ſelfe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21009:8"/> in a matter of ſuch importance, and difficulty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I would be yet more bolde, with your patience, but that I truſt and purpoſe to handle this point more at large, vpon ſome iuſter occaſion hereafter. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, that no reaſonable man, much more, that no Chriſtian, may, without great inciuility, or weakeneſſe of faith, make any queſtion of the truth of theſe books: which haue continued in eſtimation, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by the ſpace of ſo many hundred years, in deſpight of ſo many, ſo learned, and ſo mighty enemies; whereas the doctrine it ſelf, by which, through the power of God it hath, and doth preuaile, is ſo contrary to the deſire of fleſh, &amp; and blood; taking away all manner of glory from man, and couering him with ſhame, &amp; ignominy; yea, ſtripping man of his greateſt pride, <hi>the freedom of his will:</hi> without the comfort wherof, he hath (naturally) no ioy in any of his actions whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſt then is the enditer of theſe bookes; Men, eſpecially authoriſed by him, the Penners. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whome this our Euangeliſt was not the leaſt; a man ſingularly affected by our Sauiour Chriſt, and therefore often thus deſcribed, <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 23. &amp; 19. 26. &amp; 20. 2. &amp; 21. 7. 20</note> 
               <hi>The Diſciple whom Ieſus loued.</hi> That this Goſpell was of his writing, it appeareth by the end thereof, where it is ſaid; <note n="s" place="margin">Iohn, 21. 24</note> 
               <hi>This is that Diſciple, which teſtifieth theſe things &amp; wrot theſe things.</hi> Now what that Diſciple was, the twelfth verſe ſheweth. <hi>Then Peter turned about, and ſawe the Diſciple, whome Ieſus loued:</hi> vppon that ſight of him <hi>Peter</hi> tooke occaſion to queſtion with our Sauiour about him; and in the end of that conference, ſet downe by the Euangeliſt, follow the wordes I recited before, <hi>This is that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> But how ſhall we knowe, that <hi>This beloued Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> was <hi>Iohn?</hi> Surely the Goſpell no where expreſſeth who it was: as you may ſee in the places before alleaged; where there is no ſignification of his name: and, other place, wherehee is called <hi>the beloued Diſciple,</hi> there is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21009:8"/> none. Wee are therefore in this point alſo to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the perpetuall iudgement of all Chriſtians: who haue (without any doubting) deliuered this vpon their credit, as it were from hand to hand. Whereof we may the better be perſwaded, if we remember &amp; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how eaſie it was for them, that liued in this Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts time, and were (as we ſhall heare anone) the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his writing, to informe themſelues moſt certainly of the Author of this Goſpell. It may be, ſome man wil yet doubt, whether the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> were the penner of this Goſpel or no, becauſe he hath not named himſelf, as hee hath done in the Reuelation. For the ſatisfying of which doubt, it may pleaſe him to vnderſtand, that this book is an hiſtory, as thoſe of the Kings are, that of <hi>Eſter,</hi> of <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp; ſuch like, to which the Authours of them haue not ſet their names. But the other of the Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a prophecie, as the writings of <hi>Iſay, Ieremy, Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Daniel,</hi> and the reſt; euery one of which hath the Authours name particularly rehearſed in it.</p>
            <p>Now for the name it ſelf, if it may adde any credit to the perſon, or ſignify any part of his nature, or grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him, whom may we prefer before this our Euangeliſt? whoſe very name <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the originall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, ſoundeth out grace, &amp; fauour. To which if we adioyne that teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in this Goſpel, that <hi>he was the Diſciple whom Ieſus loued,</hi> what can bee thought wanting, that might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to vs? For howſoeuer the loue of God be no proof of any excellency in the party beloued, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which this loue ſhould ariſe; yet it is a moſt certain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome great worth in him, after hee is beloued: Becauſe <note n="t" place="margin">Ezec. 16. 3. 6. 7 13. 14</note> the loue of God alwayes beſtowes on him, whom it once embraceth, ſome aſſured teſtimony that hee is beloued of God. It findes nothing worth the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but it giues ſomething: it makes the party louely, though of himſelfe he be worthy of hatred.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21009:9"/>
            <p>And ſurely if euer this effect of Gods loue appeared in any (as it ſheweth it ſelf in all, that are beloued of him, more or leſſe) it was euidently to be ſeene in this our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, <note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 4. 21</note> who of a poore Fiſherman ignorant, and young, became in a ſhort ſpace admirable to all the world, for varietie, and certainety of all diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and knowledge; inſomuch that <note n="x" place="margin">Baſilius homil. in Ioa. c. 1.</note> the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and excellent of all the Philoſophers, are reported, to haue wondered at the myſteries conteined in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Goſpell, which <note n="y" place="margin">Auguſt. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. dei lib. 10. cap. 29.</note> they thought worthy to be written in letters of Gold. And yet, poore ſouls, they wondred at that, which they fully vnderſtood not. If they had been vouchſaf't that honour, and happineſs, wherof the Lord in his infinit mercy hath made vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, To conceiue, &amp; feele the truth of theſe myſteries to our euerlaſting ſaluation, oh how would they haue triumphed? And is it poſſible, wee ſhould ſo lightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it? Therfore ſhall they be our iudges, if we ſtirre not vp our dead affections to embrace, as it were with both armes, the kinde offer of ſo glorious, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous knowledge, deliuered by him, who was of all other moſt deare to our Lord, and Maiſter Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Wherof, if any man deſire to ſee more particular proofe, let him looke vpon this our Euangeliſt, <note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 13. 23. 24</note> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head louingly, and familiarly in the boſome of our Sauiour; and behold <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> a man in no ſmall fauour with his Lord Ieſus Chriſt, beckning to him, as one that might bee moſt bolde, to aske that, which (it ſeemes) none of the reſt durſt demande. Hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intereſt hee had in his Lords affection, makes bolde to aske the queſtion, <hi>who it was that ſhould betraie him;</hi> and preſently without any ſecond requeſt, receiues a plaine and ſufficient anſwere. And that it may yet more plainly appeare, what opinion the other Diſciples had of our Sauiours eſpeciall loue to him, remember I pray you the queſtion moued by <hi>Peter,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn, 21. 21</note>

You will obiect (it may be) that theſe writers ſtile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Apoſtles; as if they deſired to haue their dignity, and office knowen to all men. True it is, that they do ſo indeed, in their Epiſt. But neither did that name belong to al the faithfull, or to any, but ſome certaine men: and it was neceſſary for the authorizing of their writings. How then? Doe I condemne the title, or the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, or the continuers &amp; vſers of it? Nothing leſſe. For I gladly acknowledge, both that the Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts had eſpeciall intereſt in that name, and that there could be no danger of ſcandall; ſeeing it was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21009:10"/> not taken by themſelues, but giuen to them as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by the conſent as it were and with the liking of all true Chriſtians: whoſe purpoſe it was, not to make them Mediatours of interceſſion, betwixt God, and men vpon earth; but to ſhew the reuerend opinion, they had conceiv'd, and did hold of ſuch worthy, and holy men. And to ſay the truth, what doth the word ſignifie but <note n="d" place="margin">

               <hi>Holy.</hi> How often is it giuen, in the Scriptures, to all, that are members of the true Church, in their ſeueral Congregations? It ſhall ſuffice therfore (to ſhut vp all in one word) that wee meane not, by this title <hi>Saint,</hi> to note any office of mediation, but onely to teſtifie our reſpect, &amp; reuerence of thoſe, whom it pleaſed our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour to chooſe, and employ in ſo excellent, and glorious a ſeruice. In this ſenſe, I deſire to be vnderſtood whenſoeuer I vſe that title; and to be excuſed, in your charitable conſtruction, if, according to that liberty, which auncient, and later Diuines haue lawfully vſed, I ſometimes omit it, in naming this Euangeliſt, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his fellow Apoſtles or Euangeliſts.</p>
            <p>I may not forget to adioyne to that, which hath been ſpoken, a fewe things more, which the Scripture hath recorded of him, namely that hee was <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 4. 21</note> the ſonne of <hi>Zebede,</hi> and brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> called with him to be a Diſciple of our Sauiour, &amp; afterward <note n="f" place="margin">Luke, 6. 14</note> ſpecially choſen with the ſame his brother, to be one of the twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. All theſe things are ſo plainely deliuered in the Scripure, that it is enough to name the places, without any more adoe. But of his mother it is needful to ſpeak more particularly; becauſe it is not ſo cleer, who ſhe was, though it be as certaine: we are then to vnderſtand that his mothers name was <hi>Salome;</hi> which is thus to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <note n="g" place="margin">Matth. 27. 56</note> Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> reporting the hiſtory of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that ſtood afar off looking vpon our Sauior, when he was crucified, writeth thus of them. <hi>Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the Mother of Iames</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:21009:10"/> 
               <hi>and Ioſes, and the Mother of Zebedeus children.</hi> Now <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedeus</hi> children were <hi>Iames</hi> the elder, as he was called for difference ſake, and <hi>Iohn.</hi> But how ſhall we knowe that this womans name was <hi>Salome?</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Marke, 15. 40</note> Saint <hi>Marke</hi> tells vs ſo in theſe words. <hi>There were alſo women which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held afarre off, among whom was Mary Magdalen, the Mother of Iames the Ieſſe, and of Ioſes, and Salome.</hi> Who ſeeth not, that ſhe, whom the former Euangeliſt called <hi>the Mother of Zebedeus children,</hi> the later nameth <hi>Salome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that our Euangeliſt was the ſon of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> and <hi>Salome;</hi> vpon him as vpon the reſt, <note n="i" place="margin">Acts, 2. 3.</note> the holy Ghoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, like fiery clouen tongues, induing them with the admirable gift of vnderſtanding, and ſpeaking all ſtrange languages. Neither was he only thus qualified with the reſt, but as it ſhould ſeeme of greater account in the Church then moſt of the reſt. Therefore <note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 2. 9</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reckons him with <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> as one of the Pillars of the Chriſtian Church. Yea, our Sauiour himſelfe in his life time was wont to admit him, as it were into his priuate counſell: <note n="l" place="margin">Marke, 5. 37</note> when he went to raiſe vp <hi>Iairus</hi> daughter from death, was not <hi>Iohn</hi> one of the three, whome he made choiſe of, to take with him? <note n="m" place="margin">Matth. 17. 1</note> was not he one of the 3. witneſſes of his glorious transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration in the mount? To conclude, in <note n="n" place="margin">Mark. 14. 33</note> that his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous agony in the garden, our Euangeliſt was one, with whom our Sauiour would bee accompanied. And for the perſon of <hi>Iohn</hi> this may ſuffiſe, vnleſs perhaps ſome man look, that I ſhould adde hereunto, as a farder proof of our Sauiours loue to him, the mention of thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull reuelations, wherin the eſtate of Chriſts Church vpon earth, to the very end of the world, is liuely and certainely diſcyphered. As for other things, which are recorded touching him in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories, I will craue leaue to omit them, becauſe they little, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerne the matter, we haue in hand; &amp; I know there are but fewe preſent, that are able to ſearch the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21009:11"/> authors, as <note n="o" place="margin">Acts 17. 11.</note> the men of <hi>Beroea</hi> did the Scriptures, to ſee whether thoſe things be ſo or no.</p>
            <p>I come now from the perſon, to the writing: where firſt, for the occaſion, &amp; time of penning this Goſpel, I wil onely ſay thus much, <note n="p" place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. eccleſ. lib. 3. cap. 21</note> that it is commonly thought to haue beene written, after the returne of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt out of baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, from <hi>Pathmos;</hi> both to ſupply that which was wanting in the other three, concerning our Sauiours dooings, and ſayings, before <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was impriſoned, and alſo to ſatisfie the requeſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in <hi>Aſia,</hi> eſpecially the Epheſians, that it might be a counterpoiſon againſt thoſe hereſies, which <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> and <hi>Ebion</hi> had hatched, and whereby the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of our Lord, and Sauiour was called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherein, if any man ſhall perſume to thinke, that our Euangeliſt hath not taken ſuch a courſe, as was fit for the refuting, and ſuppreſſing of thoſe hereſies; let him learne, firſt that the holy Spirit, of whoſe enditing this Goſpell was, is not to bee taught by the blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of proude ignorant men. Then let him farder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it was not the Euangeliſts purpoſe, nor indeed a matter beſeeming the authority of him, whom the Lord vſed for his Secretary, to diſpute by writing, with prophane, and blaſphemous Apoſtates: but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Church of Chriſt in the truth formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. And this he hath performed with ſuch maieſtie, and authoritie, that we may ſee in him the grace anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that name <note n="q" place="margin">Marke, 3. 17</note>, which his Lord and Maſter gaue him, euen <hi>power to thunder.</hi> For who is not aſtonied with admiration of thoſe wonderfull myſteries, concerning our Sauior Chriſts eternal diuinitie, which this ſonne of thunder as it were ratleth out? Therefore did <note n="r" place="margin">Auguſt. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. in Ioa. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. prodromus in diſtich.</note> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient writers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare him to an Eagle, as one that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp aboue the pitch of the other three Euangeliſts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the height of the Godhead, and that vnſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myſtery of the moſt glorious, and bleſſed Trinitie.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21009:11"/>
            <p>There is indeede ſome diuerſitie of opinions amongſt the Latin Fathers, to which of the Euangeliſts the other 3. beaſts, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ezech. 2. 5 Reuelat. 4. 6.</note> Ezech. 2. 5.

Art thou then deſirous ro vnderſtand the great, &amp; high, points of diuinitie? Caſt thy ſelfe vpon the wings of this Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, who wil cary thee vp, as it were into the boſome of God, and acquaint thee with ſuch matters, as, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation from God himſelfe, could neuer poſſibly haue bin diſcouered, or imagined.</p>
            <p>And that we may the more be rauiſht with the loue of this holy Goſpell, let me put you in minde of that vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, the mother of delight, which is eaſie to bee ſeene therein. How ſweetly hath our Euangeliſt tempered, and as it were allayed, the hard points of profound knowledge, with enterlacing of delightfull Hiſtories? If at any time he ſoare aloft, that he may ſeem to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of ſight for the height of thoſe admirable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of our Sauiours diuinity, he comes down againe ere long, and feedes our eyes, with making vs ſee the vſe, and comfort of thoſe glorious inſtructions. And beſides this varietie of matter, which ſhineth in comparing one part of this Goſpel with another; there is yet a farther conſideration, to the ſingular commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof. Who is there, if hee haue anie ſenſe of Gods mercy in Chriſt, but takes great pleaſure to reade one and the ſame thing, diuerſly recorded by the other three Euangeliſts? And what meruaile? Seeing it is, euen in prophane hiſtories, a matter of no ſmall vſe, and delight, to haue the memorie renewed, and the affection quickned by the varietie of diſcourſe, as it vvere by the diuerſe cooking of ſome one daintie kinde of meat. But our Euangeliſt, to the diuerſitie of handling, hath added alſo great ſtore of newe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not once touched by any one of the other; the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21009:12"/> LORD hauing reſerued, for him, the perfecting of that knowledge, which the reſt did beginne and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Manie excellent things are recorded, by Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Luke,</hi> concerning the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and miracles of our Sauiour: yet are there but fewe of theſe proper to any one of them. Only S. <hi>Iohn</hi> affords vs, as in ſo ſhort a Treatiſe, great plenty of new, and vnknowen variety; <note n="u" place="margin">Piſcator in prooem. ad Ioan.</note> 10. Sermons, fowre miracles and that zealous prayer, full of loue and comfort. The ſermons (that I may ſpeake a word, or two, of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, in particular) are theſe: Firſt, <note n="x" place="margin">Iob. 3. 1. 2. &amp;c</note> that kinde dialogue with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and thoſe worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, concerning regeneration; whereby wee are taught, that our naturall eſtate is fleſhly, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of grace, and glorie, till the ſpirit of God by the waters of the Scriptures, haue bredde in vs a newe and heauenly conception. In the ſecond place follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth <note n="y" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 7. 8. &amp;c.</note> that ſweete, and comfortable diſcourſe, with the Woman of Samaria, concerning the water of life: which beeing once receiued into the ſoule, turnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſpring, that can neuer bee dryed vp, but ſends forth continually aboundance of freſh liquor, to coole, and moyſten the heart, in all heate of tentations.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 19. 20 &amp;c.</note> The next Chap, preſents vs with the third Sermon: wherein vpon occaſion of the ſtiffe-necked Iewes mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt our Sauiour, for willing the man, whom hee had cured, hauing beene thirtie-eight yeares bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, to take vp his bedde, and walke, though it were the Sabbath daie, wee haue a glorious aſſurance of our Lords eternall God-head, and equalitie with God his Father. But that, which exceedes in all heauenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 26. 27.</note> the fourth Sermon; in which, our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, as it were thruſts himſelfe into our mouthes, to bee eaten, and drunke; giuing vs full aſſurance, that the eating of his fleſh, and drinking of his bloud,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21009:12"/> that is, belieuing in him, ſhall feede vs without hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, or thirſting any more, to euerlaſting life; which he, according to his Fathers will, and charge, ſhal moſt certainely beſtowe vpon all them, that by true faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with him.</p>
            <p>The <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 3. 4. &amp;c.</note> fift Sermon affordes vs a worthie example of our Lord, and maſters wiſedom, and authoritie to diſcerne and confound the ſubtill malice of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies. With what diuine iudgement dooth hee looke into the depth of the Phariſies deceite, who ſought to entrappe him about the woman taken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie? With what admirable diſcretion dooth hee driue them away, to their perpetuall ſhame, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour? With what a maieſtie doth he, a little after, conuince and reprooue them, for their wilfull blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and proude conceit of the knowledge, they bragged of, but had not? Let vs come <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 1. 2. &amp;c.</note> to the ſixt of thoſe Sermons, which our Euangeliſt only hath recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In no place doth our Sauiour more plainly avow himſelfe to bee the Meſſiah: where haue wee the like certainty of his care, and loue deliuered? Hee giues his life for his ſheep, and caſts himſelfe into the very iawes of the Wolfe, that his mouth might be ſtopped: And to the ſingular comfort of vs, that are not by nature Iews, hee tells vs, that wee alſo belong to his ſheepfold. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which when wee once are receiued, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for ſheepe, no power of ſinne, Satan, or death, ſhall bee able to wring vs out of his hands; becauſe the Father, with whom he is in nature all one, is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then all.</p>
            <p>The former ſixe Sermons containe eſpecially thoſe benefites whereof wee are made partakers by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt in this life: but <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 25. 26 &amp;c</note> the ſeauenth expreſſeth our finall triumph, ouer our laſt and greateſt enemie, Death himſelfe. Thoſe helpe both to arme vs to the fight, and to encourage, and further vs in fighting;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21009:13"/> but this crownes vs after victory. If the body ſhall riſe againe to glorie, we may truely, and ſafelie chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Death and ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Oh Death, where is thy ſting? oh Graue, where is thy victorie?</hi> For if our bodies bee made immortall, where is the power of Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? Who then can faint in a battaile? the iſſue whereof will bee ſo certaine, and happy? eſpecially if hee remember, what gracious promiſes he hath from God in <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 14. &amp; 15. &amp; 16.</note> the eight Sermon, of the continuall aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt. For, howſoeuer, thoſe glorious matters principally concerne the Apoſtles, yet hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chriſtian his intereſt in them, according to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proportion. The Apoſtles coulde not erre in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie matter of Doctrine. No true Chriſtian ſhall ſo erre in matters neceſſarie to his ſaluation, that hee ſhall bee cut off from beeing a member of IESVS CHRIST; but ſhall haue his meaſure of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Peace, and Comfort, according to the trialls, that his heauenlie Father hath appointed to make of him.</p>
            <p>The two laſt Sermons do eſpecially concerne two of the Apoſtles; but were written for our learning, and conſolation. In <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 26. 27. &amp;c.</note> the former, our Sauiour inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Thomas,</hi> with a milde reproofe of his not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and a ſenſible demonſtration of that he doubted of. To which he addes (to our vnſpeakeable comfort) that <note n="h" place="margin">Verſe, 29</note> all they, which hauing not ſeene, nor felt, as THOMAS then did, yet beleeue, are trewlie bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>Neyther is <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 21. 15. 16</note> the later of the two ſo appropria<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> but that it affordes vs alſo this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent leſſon; that the ſtrongeſt proofe of euery Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters loue to his Lord, and maſter Ieſus Chriſt, is the faithfull, and carefull feeding and directing of the ſheepe, and lambes committed to his charge. And theſe are the tenne Sermons, which none of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21009:13"/> but <hi>Iohn</hi> only, hath mentioned. I deny not, that the points of diuinity, contained in them, may bee gathered (more or leſſe) out of the other three; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Sermons recorded by them, nor the matters (therein deliuered) ſo plainely, and fully handled, as in this Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as if we come to a Faire to buy any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, which wee neede or deſire, wee content not our ſelues, to ſtaie in ſuch a ſhop, or booth, as can ſhew vs only one peece, and that made vp ſo cloſe, that wee can hardly looke into it; but ſeeke thither vvhere wee may haue choiſe, and ſee the wares opened to our full view: So let vs make haſte to this Goſpell, in which many, and ſo goodly matters are vnfolded, and eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry bolte, and pleight layd open. As for the miracles, whereof I will ſay verie little, they are ſuch as are not once pointed at, nor ſignified by anie other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt: Who beſides <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 2. 3. 4. &amp;c.</note> Saint IOHN, giues vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the leaſt inkling of water turned into wine, at a marriage, by our Sauiour, CHRIST? Had not <note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 5. 6. &amp;c.</note> that famous miracle, by which the man, that had lyen bed-rid xxxviij. yeares, was cured, ſo that he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roſe and carried awaie his bed, been altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, and vnheard of, if our Euangeliſt had not committed it to writing? None but he, tells vs of <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 9. 1. 2. &amp;c.</note> the man, that beeing borne blinde, and hauing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo, manie yeares, had ſight giuen him by ſuch a meanes, as in mans reaſon, was fitter to haue put out his eyes, if hee could haue ſeene. But hee that made duſt, and ſpittle, can by duſt, and ſpittle, doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer pleaſeth him. The <note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 38. 35 &amp;c.</note> laſt miracle, is the rayſing of LAZARVS from the dead, not as <note n="o" place="margin">Marke, 5. 42</note> IAIRVS daughter was reſtored to life, lying in her bedde, after the breath vvas departed from her, nor as <note n="p" place="margin">Luke, 7. 15</note> the VVidowes ſonne had life put into him againe, as hee vvas carrying to be buryed; but euen then, when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21009:14"/> he had continued till the fourth daie in the graue, and, in his moſt kind ſiſters iudgement, could not chuſe, but ſtinke.</p>
            <p>Admirable and glorious are theſe miracles, and ſuch as ought to aſſure vs of his diuine power, who was able to do things ſo vnpoſſible to men, and Angels. But as <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 2</note> the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preferred the knowledge of Chriſt crucified, before all other glorious myſteries, becauſe therein (properly) ſtands the iuſtification of a ſinner: ſo haue we very good cauſe to valew <note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 1. 2.&amp;c.</note> that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and feruent prayer of our Sauiour, aboue all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>For if euer his loue and care of vs appeared in anie thing, hee did, or ſpake, (except his paſſion) in that it ſhines and ſhews it ſelfe moſt cleerely <note n="s" place="margin">Verſe, 20</note> With what zeale doth hee commend euery one, that at any time beleeues in him, to God his Father? <note n="t" place="margin">Ver, 21. 22. 23</note> How doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate, and double his requeſt to God, that wee may be made one with God? But I may not ſtand long vpon theſe points; eſpecially ſince they are to be expounded at large hereafter, if it pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Now the ſumme of all is this, that ſeeing it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord, ſo graciouſly, and plentifully to vouchſafe vs the certaine knowledge of ſuch excellent myſteries; and that by one ſo highly in the fauour of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo aſſuredly directed by the holy Ghoſt: wee in like ſort, ſhould beſtowe all paines, and diligence, that this knowledge may bee rooted in our hearts, and bring forth abundance of fruite, in our whole conuerſation, to the glorie of his Name, and our endleſſe comfort, in the ſame our Lord, and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Neither let it diſcourage, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend anie man, that our Euangeliſt was no learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, trayned vp in anie Vniuerſitie; nor fitted for ſuch a peece of work, by any extraordinary parts of nature, or ſtudy. Yea rather let it encourage, and ſtrengthen
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21009:14"/> him in faith; conſidering how vnpoſſible it is, that a poore Fiſherman, ſhould haue the head to conceiue, and the heart to vtter, ſuch myſteries, with confidence, and aſſurance, againſt the iudgement, &amp; liking of almoſt, all the learned, and mighty of the world. Could theſe admirable myſteries be of a Fiſhermans deuiſing?

But our Euangeliſt thunders out moſt admirable ſecrets, &amp; that without all doubting in himſelf of the truth therof, &amp; threatens aſſured dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to all them, who refuſe to giue abſolute credit to whatſoeuer he hath deliuered.

This appeares plainely in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpell, where the great myſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion are deliuered.</p>
            <p>Theſe two firſt verſes conteine a deſcription of our Sauiours diuine nature; propounded in the firſt verſe, and repeated in the ſecond. In the former, he is ſet out to vs by that, which concerneth the nature of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and his perſon in the Godhead.

Where are they now, that lewdly, and prophanely ſcoffe at Chriſtian Religion, becauſe forſooth it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth nothing, but that, which is common, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Common and ordinarie? So ſtrange, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie are the ſecrets of the Goſpell, that no man of himſelfe, is able to deuiſe them, by his wit, or to beleeue them with his heart. Take the deepeſt points of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philoſophie (ſo they bee indeed true) and a man of good capacitie, will quickly, and eaſily be brought to giue aſſent to the truth thereof: becauſe hee hath in him the light of naturall reaſon, whereby they may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely be diſcerned. But the ſecrets of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are ſuch, and ſo farre aboue the reach of humane reaſon, that although you make a man vnderſtand them neuer ſo perfectly, yet you cannot poſſibly make him acknowledge them for truth. Truth in philoſophie is ſuch, as that reaſon, if a man ſuffer himſelfe to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by it, will enforce him to beleeue it. Trueth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie is ſuch, as that the more we hearken to our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reaſon, the leſſe we are perſwaded of the myſteries of religion. It is for him, and for him onely to incline the heart to the beliefe of thoſe ſecrets, who firſt reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to be beleeued.</p>
            <p>But what doe I? While I labour to ſet out the excellencie of the Goſpell, by ſhewing, that it contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many ſtrange, and hidden myſteries, it may bee feared, that I driue men away from the hearing, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, by the darkeneſs, and profoundneſſe of theſe ſecrets. But be not diſcouraged (brethren) I beſeech
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21009:17"/> you. If they were more obſcure, and deepe, then they are, yet who could deſpaire of ſounding the depth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as long as he may haue ſo skilfull, and able a Pilot?

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and humbly, that God being from all eternitie infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in wiſedome, hath alwayes had ſome conception in him, as a man hath, when he diſcourſeth in his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This conception in man, though it remaine in the ſoule, yet is not of the ſubſtance of the ſoule. But in God, that is moſt ſimple, and without all manner of compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there can bee nothing that is not of his Diuine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. This conception of God is the ſecond perſon in Trinitie, the Sonne of God. Would any know, why the like conception in man, is not the Sonne of man? Let him remember, that the Sonne muſt be of the ſame nature with the Father; as our conception is not without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but Gods is of neceſſitie, becauſe (as I ſaid ere while) there can bee no compoſition; I adde, nor imperfection, in the diuine Nature. The firſt reaſon then, why the Sonne of God is named the Word, is this, that he is begotten by his father in ſuch manner, as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde word, or conception is framed in vs. Theſe things I confeſſe ſeeme to mee, ſomewhat curious, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, that I can hardly perſwade my ſelfe, they were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Euangeliſt: neither would I haue aduentured to propound them to you, but for reuerence of <note n="o" place="margin">Dionyſ.

That the former is a part of our Sauiour Chriſts office, and hath bene performed by him, from time to time, it hath bin held, time out of mind; and may be prooued, for theſe later times, out of the Scripture. Who (almoſt) is ignorant, that <note n="q" place="margin">Tertul. contr.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21009:21"/> For it is well knowen to all men, that by the word of God in the Scripure, either ſome commandement from God, or ſome reuelation, or ſome part of the doctrine of the Scripture, or ſome ſuch thing is ſignified. Therefore, that the Meſſiah might be vnderſtood to be here ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, it was conuenient, and in a maner neceſſary, to call him <hi>the word,</hi> and not <hi>the word of God;</hi> yet I would be loth to ſtand too much vpon this reaſon, becauſe our Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <note n="a" place="margin">Reuel. 19. 13</note> other where doubts not to call him <hi>the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will aske, why the Euangeliſt would call him <hi>the VVord,</hi> and not rather <hi>The Sonne of God,</hi> or <hi>The Sonne.</hi> was hee affraide (<note n="b" place="margin">Baſilius homil. in haec verba. Leontius incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theop.

If hee would not call him the Sonne, yet hee needed not haue named him the word, ſeeing hee had ſuch choice of titles to giue him; <hi>The wiſedome of the Father, the Light, the Brightneſſe,</hi> and many other of the like kind, as is plaine in the Scripture. It is likely therefore, that there was ſome eſpeciall reaſon of that choiſe. What might that be? Surely it is not vnlike, that <hi>the Meſſiah</hi> was commonly ſo tearmed among the Iewes; or that the ſecond perſon in the Trinitie was knowen beſt to them, by that name.

            <p>IT is generally thought, and I thinke not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly, that the blaſphemous hereſies of <note n="f" place="margin">Anno, 85</note>

               <hi>Cerinthus</hi> (who denyed that our Sauiour was God, or had anie being, before he tooke fleſh of the holy Virgine his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was one eſpeciall occaſion of writing this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. To root out that impious conceit, and to eſtabliſh the faithful in an aſſured beliefe of our bleſſed Sauiours eternall God-head, our Euangeliſt, truly, and with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall authority affirmeth, that <hi>the VVord was in the beginning.</hi> Neither doth he content himſelfe therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: but for the further inſtruction of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, hee addes, that <hi>The VVord was with God, and was God,</hi> yea that <hi>The ſame VVord was in the beginning with</hi> GOD.</p>

            <p>The firſt point of our Sauiours eternitie, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded (as it pleaſed God to enhable mee) in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exerciſe: I am now (by his gracious aſſiſtance) to goe forwarde with that, which followes; <hi>The VVord was with God.</hi> Wherein for the words themſelues, firſt wee muſt enquire, what is meant by God, then what the Euangeliſt woulde teach vs, when hee ſayth, <hi>The VVord was with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <note n="h" place="margin">Orig. in Ioa. lib. 2. Chryſoſt. in Ioan. hom. 2</note> God, when the word is properly taken, not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a creature, ſignifieth either the <hi>Diuine</hi> nature in all three perſons, <hi>The Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost,</hi> or only the firſt of the three, <hi>The Father.</hi> Examples of the former are in euerie leafe, and page of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Let vs alleage one or two out of this Goſpell. <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh 4. 24</note> 
               <hi>God is a ſpirit.</hi> Not <hi>God the Father onely:</hi> but the <hi>Sonne</hi> alſo, and the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> For this ſpiritualneſſe is a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the diuine nature, not of anie one perſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: elſe ſhould not the other two bee ſpirituall. <hi>The</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 2.</note> 
               <hi>time ſhall come, that whoſoeuer killeth you, vvill thinke, he doth God ſeruice.</hi> Surely no man, that killeth Chriſtians, for beleeuing in CHRIST IESVS, can thinke hee doth ſeruice to the Trinity. For our Sauiour CHRIST is one of the three. But the idolatrous heathen, and the ſuperſtitious Iewes make accompt, that they performe acceptable ſeruice to God, namely to <hi>the diuine nature,</hi> when they deſtroy them, that acknowledge the three perſons to bee one God, or deny that there are more Gods then one, or worſhippe our Sauiour Chriſt as God.</p>
            <p>Of the later, the old Teſtament affords vs few exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or none, the new very many: and to make ſhort, whereſoeuer God and the Sonne or Ieſus Chriſt are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned together, there <hi>by God, the Father</hi> is ſignified. <note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16</note> 
               <hi>So God loued the world, that he gaue his only begotten Sonne;</hi> God? what? not <hi>the diuine nature.</hi> For that hath no Son
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21009:27"/> to giue: elſe ſhould the ſecond perſon haue a Sonne, and the third to; becauſe both the <hi>Sonne and the holie Ghost are the diuine nature or God,</hi> no leſſe then the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> But euery mans owne reaſon teacheth him, that the Sonne is the Fathers Sonne. So that by God, which gaue his Sonne, <hi>God the Father is vnderſtood.</hi> The ſame Father is alſo meant by the name of God, when hee is mentioned with Chriſt. <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 1. 8</note> 
               <hi>I thanke my God</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>through</hi> IESVS CHRIST, euen him, whom in the next Verſe before he had called <hi>God our Father;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe, 7 Verſe, 9</note> and whoſe <hi>Sonne</hi> in the ver. following he maketh Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>God is my witneſſewhome I ſerue with my ſpirit in the Goſpell of his Sonne.</hi> Of the ſame kinde are all thoſe places, where there is any mention of praying to God, in, or thorough CHRIST. For, to him hath our Sauiour taught vs to pray. <note n="n" place="margin">Luke, 11. 2</note> 
               <hi>VVhen yee pray</hi> ſaie, <hi>Our Father vvhich art in heauen,</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 23</note> 
               <hi>VVhatſoeuer yee aske the Father in my name hee will giue it you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee, in whether of theſe two ſignifications the word God is to bee taken, in this place. Surelie, not in the former, becauſe then <hi>The VVord</hi> ſhould haue beene with himſelfe: which is no reaſonable ſpeech. For who vnderſtands not, that euery thing which is ſaid to be with an other, is diuerſe from that, with which it is ſayde to bee? Therefore if <hi>the VVord vverewith God; the VVord was not God.</hi> But the Euangeliſt directly auoucheth, that <hi>the VVord vvas God:</hi> What remaines then, if by God wee will haue the <hi>Diuine nature to bee meant,</hi> but that wee muſt confeſſe, there are two Gods? <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord,</hi> and hee, <hi>vvith vvhom the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord vvas.</hi> But it is certaine in Religion and reaſon, that there is but one God. And therefore God may not at any hand bee conceiued in this place to bee put for <hi>the Diuine Nature or Godhead.</hi> If it ſeeme to any man, that <hi>the VVord</hi> may bee ſayd to be with God, though it be God, as a mans ſoule is ſaid to be with him, whoſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21009:28"/> ſoule it is; <note n="p" place="margin">Auguſt. de Trinit. lib. 6. cap 2.</note> I muſt deſire him to conſider, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not alike. For the ſoule is part of the man, with whome it is ſayd to be; but the word is not part of the diuine nature: which is moſt ſimple, and free from all kinde of compoſition.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie then for any man to conclude, that God in this part of the Verſe, is the firſt perſon in the Trinitie, <hi>God the Father.</hi> And that it may the rather appeare, vnto vs, that wee rightly vnderſtand and expound the Euangeliſt, we haue his owne warrant; where ſpeaking of the ſame our bleſſed Sauiour, hee ſayth of him, that <note n="q" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 2</note> 
               <hi>Hee was with the Father:</hi> I forbeare to enlarge the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Euery man may eaſily perceiue that our Euange. liſt handles the ſame point in both places, that hee need not doubt, but that God, <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> with whom the Word was, <hi>is God the Father.</hi> What ſhall we ſay then of that collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſome make vpon the Article, which is vſed by the Euangeliſt, in the Greeke? He ſaith not ſimply, God (ſay theſe men) but <hi>The God,</hi> giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, that our Sauiour was with the true God; not with him who was God, but onely by fauour, and not alſo by nature. That, they ſay concerning God, is true and certaine. But we haue learned, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there ſignified, and not the nature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it coulde not bee the Euangeliſts meaning to note vnto vs the truth of the diuine nature by that article.</p>
            <p>Neither (I thinke) was there euer any heretick found, who denied that God, with whome the word is ſaid to haue bin, was God by nature; what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meaneth the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle? Doubtleſs, either it is added only according to the cuſtome of the greeke tongue, wherof there are infinite examples in all authors, and namely in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or els (if any thing were intended by it) the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt meant to ſhew, that in this clauſe of the ſentence he put the word <hi>God</hi> in another ſenſe, then hee doth in the clauſe following, where the article is omitted: but I rather
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21009:28"/> perſwade my ſelfe, that there is nothing intended ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the holy Ghoſt; but the manner of ſpeech obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, according to the nature of the language.</p>
            <p>Some man perhaps will yet farder demand, why the Euangeliſt did not ſpeak plainly, as he meant, and call him the Father, rather then God. To whom I anſwer, that the Euangeliſt, hauing in the former part named <hi>The VVord,</hi> and not <hi>The Sonne,</hi> doth here more fitlie mention God, then the Father. For ſo the nature of the things ſeemes to require; The Sonne of the Father, the Word of God. Beſides, it helpes that elegancie, which the holy Ghoſt vſeth in this place, making the laſt word of the former clauſe, the firſt of the later. <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the VVord, and the VVord was with God, and God vvas the VVord.</hi> For ſo lie the words in the Greeke, whereof anone. Now if in the ſecond clauſe, hee had ſayde, <hi>The VVord vvas vvith the Father,</hi> the grace of the ſpeech had beene loſt, becauſe he could not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the word in the beginning of the clauſe, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. For it cannot be truely ſaid, that <hi>the Father is the VVord, or the VVord the Father:</hi> but to ſay, <hi>God vvas the the VVord,</hi> is a true and an elegant ſpeech. What if we adde hereunto, that in the olde Teſtament, where the Meſſiah is ſpoken of, there (ordinarily) not the Father, but God is named? when the firſt inkling of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was giuen, who gaue it but God? Then <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 3. 14. 15</note>

                  </gap>. 3. 14. 16</note> when he ſpeaks of the promiſe by name, and which <note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 3. 8</note> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tearmes <hi>the preaching of the Goſpell:</hi> Was it not <hi>God</hi> that ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

               <hi>In thee ſhal all the families of the earth be bleſſed?</hi> To be ſhort look from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Geneſis to the end of <hi>Malachy,</hi> and ſee how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you finde any diſtinct mention of the firſt perſon, vnder the name of the Father. Therefore he that made choiſe of ſuch a name for our Sauiour CHRIST, as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21009:29"/> hee was well knowen by, among the Iewes, could not doe better, then by the like wiſdom, ſo to ſpeak of God the Father, as his ſpeech might bee beſt approued, and vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>God then, in this ſecond part of the verſe, ſignifies <hi>The Father.</hi> But what is the Euangeliſts meaning when hee ſayth, <hi>The VVord was with God?</hi> What is it to bee <hi>with the Father?</hi> Manie and diuers haue beene the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures of the learned, concerning this matter. That the vnity of nature in the Father, and the Sonne, was hereby ſignified. But that is ſufficiently manifeſt, by the laſt clauſe, where the Word is affirmed to bee God For ſeeing there can bee but one God, and that the Sonne is auouched to bee God, as well as the Father, who ſees not, that they are both one and the ſame God, and ſo all one in their diuine nature? But this and moſt of the other opinions, which I will not trouble you withall in this kinde of exerciſe, are rather conſequents that follow vpon that, which our Euangeliſt intended, then the verie point it ſelfe, which hee did intende. Firſt therefore let vs ſearch out the principall drift of theſe words, and afterwarde as neede ſhall bee, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thoſe points, that are neceſſary. What may then bee the ſenſe of this word <hi>with?</hi> what ſhoulde wee ſeeke farre? <note n="y" place="margin">Baſil. homil. in haec verba.</note> take it as it commonly ſignifies, and it will agree with Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> occaſion and purpoſe. Hee had ſayde in the former wordes that <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord</hi> had alreadie his beeing, when all things, that euer were created, began firſt to bee. What would a man reaſonably doubt of heereupon? Was the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, before the creation, before there was anie time or place, wherein hee might bee? where was he then? To this, our Euangeliſt anſweres plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily. <hi>The VVord was with God. As if hee ſhould haue ſaide: Doe you doubt whether the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord were in the beginning or no, becauſe you cannot imagine, vvhere</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:21009:29"/> 
               <hi>hee ſhould bee, when as yet there was no world to be in? Can you conceiue, that God was, who is the Father of the VVord? Looke then vvhere hee vvas, and there vvas the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord. For the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord vvas vvith God.</hi> Euen as the inwarde conception or word, which the vnderſtanding of man frameth within him, is with the man, where hee is: ſo the Word of God, is with God. This I take to bee the plaine and certaine meaning of the Euangeliſt, and that according to the true iudgement of ſome auntient and later writers.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Arius</hi> beſtirres himſelfe, and hearing that our Sauiour <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord</hi> was with God, hee dreames, that <hi>Hee vvas nothing elſe,</hi> but a created Spirit, created in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede before the world, but yet created; as (ſayth hee) it may euidently bee gathered, becauſe <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord</hi> being with God, was not God, with whom he was. Who is ſo blind, as hee, that wilfully refuſeth to ſee? Euery childe can anſwer <hi>Arius,</hi> that <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ord</hi> was not God the Father, with whome hee is ſayde to haue beene: yet was the ſame God: diſtinct in perſon, all one in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo then hee was truely with the Father, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Alius, nou aliud</note> perſon, not of a diuerſe nature from the Father, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This I take to be the true &amp; natural ſenſe of the words, and the very proper meaning of our holy Euangeliſt, S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Now let vs adde the other obſeruations, rather then interpretations: which, as before I ſignified, are not directly intended, but neceſſarily followe vppon the former doctrine. And firſt we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that, which ſhewes our Sauiours Diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: then we will deliuer thoſe poyntes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his perſon; both, ſhortly, and plainely, as it ſhall pleaſe God to vouchſafe aſſiſtance. Now the Diuine Nature or Godhead of our Sauiour Chriſt appeares in this, that being with God, when as yet there neuer had bin any thing created, he culd be no other, but God. For how is it poſſible, that when there is nothing but God, that, which is then, ſhould not bee God? If you ſay with <hi>Arius,</hi> that hee was created; you deny that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all creation is truely deſcribed by <hi>Moſes</hi> when he ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>In the beginning God created heauen and earth.</hi> For if that you ſay bee true, the moſt excellent part of the creation was already paſt, namely the making of him, by whom all theſe things afterward were created. Who taught this ſtrange Diuinity? Where is any ſuch thing recorded in any part of Scripture? Who is ſo ſhameleſſe, as to ſay he hath it by reuelation? Who ſo ſenſeleſſe as to beleeue him, that will ſay ſo? This is our wiſedome, to know what it hath pleaſed God to reueale to vs in the Scripture, either expreſly, or by conſequence, and to accompt nothing elſe a matter neceſſary to bee beleeued. So then, when we read
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21009:31"/> or heare that our Sauiour was with God, wee learne thereby, that hee is himſelfe God. For what can be bee but God, that had his being before, and without all creation?</p>
            <p>The word perhaps troubles thee, becauſe he is ſaid to haue beene <hi>with God,</hi> and therefore as it may ſeeme, not God, but an other. An other? Thou ſaieſt well. <note n="h" place="margin">Tertullian. contra Praxea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cap. 8.</note> For hee is indeede in perſon (as I aunſwered once before) another.

            <p>And this laſt point, concerning our Sauiour Chriſts perſon, <note n="n" place="margin">Tertullian. contra Praxea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cap. 12.</note> is manifeſtly, &amp; vndoubtedly proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by this part of the verſe. For it cannot bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that any thing beeing in all reſpects, one and the ſame, ſhould bee ſaide to bee with it ſelfe, or in it ſelfe. <hi>The word was with God:</hi> If there be no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt <hi>the word</hi> &amp; <hi>God,</hi> how can it be conceiued
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21009:32"/> that <hi>the word was with God?</hi> I ſhall neede to ſpend the leſſe time and paines in this matter, becauſe none but <note n="o" place="margin">Auguſt. de haer. cap. 4.</note> the Sabellians, euer made queſtion of it. They decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues and other men, with an vnlikely fancy, againſt euidence of Scripture, that God was but one perſon; called in diuers reſpects, ſometimes the Father, ſometimes the Sonne, &amp; ſometimes the holy Ghoſt. But what reſpect can make this ſpeech reaſonable, if there be but one perſon in the Godhead? Let vs conſider the point a little better. <hi>Dauid</hi> was in regard of his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a king, in reſpect of his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> a father, in relation to his wife <hi>Berſheba</hi> an husband, for his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature a man. May I ſay of him, becauſe of theſe diuers reſpects, that the father of <hi>Saelomon,</hi> was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi> or with the man, meaning <hi>Dauid?</hi> Would not a man laugh at the abſurditie of ſuch a ſpeech? It cannot be then, but that hee, which was with God, was really diſtinct, or was truely and indeed another from him, with whom hee was. No reſpect will free the ſpeech from a iuſt imputation of abſurditie, if the partie ſpoken of, bee one and the ſame, as well for perſon, as for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I reſerue the farder handling of this matter till I come to the end of the verſe following, where I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe if it pleaſe God, to deliuer the doctrine of the holy Trinitie.</p>
            <p>It may alſo farder be gathered, that the Euangeliſt in ſaying, <hi>The word was with God,</hi> would haue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he, <note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> which, in the fulneſſe of time appointed by God, tooke fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was till that time with God, though vnſeene and vnknowen to the world; not as if he were not there ſtill, (for euen while he was here vpon the earth, he was alſo at the ſame time continually in heauen; <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 13. &amp; 17. 23.</note> 
               <hi>The Sonne of man, which is in heauen:</hi> and <hi>I will that they be, where I am)</hi> but becauſe he came into the world, where before he had not beene in the nature of man. Heereto belongeth that, which is

            <p>We may alſo adde hereunto, that <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ambroſ. de incarna. domini Greg. Nyſten. de fide ad Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plic. Rupertus a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>this being with the Father</hi> implies the glory, he had, and hath with him: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>The word which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was at the right hand of God, in the glory of the Father, equall to the Father.</hi> Why ſeeke you the Creator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Creatures? If you deſire to know where <hi>the VVord was,</hi> conſider that he was at the right hand of God the Father, partaker of that glory, which the Lord neither will, nor can giue to any, which is not the ſame God with him. But of this enough. Let vs come to the laſt part of the verſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the VVord was God;</hi> or as the Greeke words lie, <hi>God was the VVord:</hi> but our tongue will hardly beare that kind of ſpeech, vnleſſe the ſenſe be altred. For if you ſay, <hi>God was the VVord,</hi> an Engliſh man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that you tell him what God was, and not what the <hi>Word</hi> was. The Greeke, and Latine may well beare ſuch placing of the words, the Engliſh will not: yet perhaps it had beene plainer euen in the Greeke, to haue ſet the words in order, as the ſenſe of them was intended, and to haue ſaid, <hi>The word was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Euangeliſt (as I noted once before, vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) followed an elegancie of ſpeech, which had bin loſt, if he had kept the naturall order of the words. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and God was the word.</hi> The like figure alſo hath <hi>Moſes.</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Gene. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>In the beginning God created heauen and earth, and the earth was without forme.</hi> But our Euangeliſt affordes vs more examples of it. <note n="u" place="margin">Iohn. 1. 4. 5</note> 
               <hi>In it was life, and that life was the light of men.</hi> And <hi>the light ſhineth in darkeneſſe, and the</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:21009:33"/> 
               <hi>darkeneſſe comprehended it not.</hi> Can any man doubt, that the holy Ghoſt intended to keepe the elegancy of the figure? Are not the Sermons of our Sauiour himſelfe beautified with flowers of Eloquence? Doth not the prophecie of <hi>Eſaie</hi> flowe with ſtreames of <hi>Rhetoricke?</hi> I dare boldly ſay, It is a very hard matter, to match the beginning of that booke, for varietie and force of Eloquence, out of the writings of any of the heathen Orators, Greeke or Latine, quantitie for quantitie; That we may iuſtly blame the ignorance, and boldneſſe of them, who thinke it a diſhonour to the Goſpell, that the preaching thereof ſhould be graced with humane Eloquence.</p>
            <p>I would know of theſe men, what it is, they call humane Eloquence: and what Eloquence there is in the Scripture, which may not beare that name, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſgrace thereunto. Are there not the ſame tropes, and figures, both of the word and the ſentence in the writings of men, yea of heathen men, which are in the Scripture? Or if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue any, which men haue not yet obſerued, may they not learne from thence, asto liue holily, ſo to ſpeake eloquently? If any man imagine, that the holy Ghoſt hath either appropriated any ornament of ſpeech to himſelfe, in the Scripture, or that he deuiſed new tropes and figures, for his owne Secretaries the holy Prophets and Apoſtles; the writings of the heathen (wherein all thoſe elegancies are to bee found) will giue euidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ignorance. I deny not, that there is a certaine maieſtie ſhining in the Scripture, which no man can worthily expreſſe by imitation, or by meditation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſufficiently. But this ariſeth, partly from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe, and partly from the skill of vſing thoſe Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall ornaments, wherein, as in all things, the holy Ghoſt, that taught them, is perfect; whereas men haue but a ſhadow as it were of his perfection. But I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21009:33"/> may not ſpend too much time in this matter: onely thus much, I will adde; that he, which in his publike miniſtrie ſhall either willingly refraine, or careleſſely neglect to vſe the helpe of humaine learning, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Rhetoricke (whereof onely wee haue now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeake) ſhall both faile in his duetie to God, and come ſhort of that worthy effect of preaching, whereby the loue of God to vs, is moſt gloriouſly ſet foorth, and our loue to God moſt ardently ſet on fire. It is the ſpirit of God, that begets faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: But not without thoſe meanes, by which hee hath enabled his ſeruants to teach, and perſwade. The principall thing, is the matter, as it were the dart or arrowe that pierceth the heart of man, by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Spirit. But ſpeech is, as it were the arme; and Eloquence, the thong or ſtring, whereby it is ſent with force to the marke it aymes at. He that truſts in Eloquence, makes fleſh his arme. Hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth Eloquence, takes ſtrength from his arme. It is our duetie to vſe the meanes. It is Gods bleſſing that the meanes take effect: and of this, vpon this occaſion, enough.</p>
            <p>Now in expounding the words, ere I come to the meaning of the place, I will firſt touch a cauill of <note n="x" place="margin">Auguſt. de doctrin. Chriſtia. lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> the <hi>Arians,</hi> whereby they endeauoured to voyde the euidence, that is brought in heere for our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſts Godhead. What could be ſpoken more plaine, then for the Euangeliſt to ſay, <hi>The VVord was God?</hi> Yet would they ſhift off the matter, by mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſentence, in this ſort. <hi>God VVas;</hi> ſay the <hi>Arians;</hi> what ſhall then become <hi>of the Word?</hi> That (ſay they) belongs to the next verſe, which muſt thus bee read; <hi>The ſame word was in the beginning with God.</hi> I told you before, that the order of the words in the text is, <hi>God was the VVord.</hi> In our language, <hi>word</hi> may not bee put before <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>this ſame:</hi> In Greeke it may,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21009:34"/> and ſo in Latine. How then ſhall wee anſwere the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians?</hi> Plainely, and truely; that there was no reaſon, why the Euangeliſt ſhould tell vs, that God <hi>was.</hi> For neither did any man doubt of it, and hee had ſaid ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to that purpoſe in the former clauſe, when he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that <hi>The Word was with God:</hi> with whom the Word, could not be conceiued to be, but that the being of God muſt of neceſſitie bee preſuppoſed. Beſides, the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture, neuer ſpeakes of God, to ſhewe his being by <hi>Was,</hi> but either by <hi>Is,</hi> the preſent tenſe or time, as we call it; <note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 3. 14</note> 
               <hi>I am ſent me:</hi> or by all three times; <note n="*" place="margin">Reuel. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Is, VVas, Shall be; which was, which is, and which is to come:</hi> yea the very clauſes of the verſe might haue taught them, that <hi>the VVord</hi> muſt needes belong to this verſe. <hi>In the beginning was the VVord, and the VVord was with God, and the VVord was God.</hi> Cut off the <hi>VVord</hi> from this laſt clauſe, and you make it altogether vnlike the former, and ſpoile the grace of the ſpeech. Let the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> goe then with their fooliſh ſhift, and goe wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in our expoſition.</p>
            <p>Wherein we are firſt to learne, what the Euangeliſt meanes by <hi>God,</hi> then to ſhew how the ſentence it ſelfe is to be vnderſtood. In the former clauſe one perſon of the Trinitie, euen the firſt, God the Father was ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the name of God, which is common to all the three. Here the ſame word is taken in the proper ſenſe, nothing the Diuine Nature. There needs no other proofe of this matter, but onely to make you ſee that if you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dit of any one perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you auouch ſomwhat which is vntrue. For example, will you ſay God the Father is the Word, or the Word was the Father? By this maner of ſpeech you confound, &amp; ſo deſtroy the perſons, whoſe very being neceſſarily requireth, that the one bee not the other. Neither may we ſay, that the holy Ghoſt was the Word, or the Word the holy Ghoſt. For the ſame errors enſue thereupon, and the Trinitie of perſons is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21009:34"/> ouerthrowen thereby. It cannot be then, but that <hi>God,</hi> in this laſt part of the verſe, muſt of neceſſity be taken for the Godhead or Diuine nature; whereupon it followes neceſſarily, that our Sauiour Chriſt is God.</p>
            <p>Againſt this the <hi>Sabellians</hi> (who acknowledge no diſtinction of perſons) except; and labour to perſwade vs, that the Euangeliſt is rather thus to bee expounded: <hi>God was the Word,</hi> that is (ſay they) <hi>That God the Father, with whom the word was, was nothing elſe, but the word it ſelfe.</hi> How falſe, &amp; fooliſh this expoſition is, if any man ſee not by himſelfe, he may thus eaſily diſcerne. To what purpoſe could it be, for the Euangeliſt to tell vs, that <hi>the VVord was with God,</hi> if hee were nothing elſe, but God, in no reſpect truely and really diſtinct from him, with whom hee is ſaid to haue beene? Had it not bene readier, and fitter for him, to haue added this laſt clauſe to the firſt, and to haue left the middlemoſt out? If you doubt where <hi>This VVord was,</hi> who I ſay <hi>was in the beginning,</hi> he was God: who can looke for any better anſwere? For it were a ſenſeleſſe blaſphemie to aske, where God was, whom all men graunt to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. But that middle clauſe, <hi>The VVord was with God,</hi> troubles the whole ſentence, darkens the ſenſe, yea to ſay the truth, leaues no ſenſe at all, if there be no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Perſons. For (as I ſhewed erewhile) no man can either truely ſay, or reaſonably conceiue, that any thing, becauſe of ſome diuers accidentall reſpects, is with itſelfe. Our Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was an Apoſtle of our Sauiour Chriſt, the Diſciple, whom Ieſus loued, the brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zebede;</hi> I might adde many other ſuch differences. But, might I therefore ſay of him, <hi>The Diſciple, whom Ieſus loued, was with the Euangeliſt Iohn, and that Diſciple was Iohn?</hi> It is one thing to be the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn,</hi> another thing to be with the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn.</hi> That agrees to none, but to <hi>Iohn</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: this may belong to any, but to him. Therefore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21009:35"/> howſoeuer theſe later words, <hi>God was the VVord,</hi> might of their own nature admit ſuch an interpretation; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the former clauſe, to which they are ioyned, it is abſurd ſo to expound them. What if I adde herunto, that the holy Ghoſt himſelfe ſeemes to tell vs, that the word <hi>God</hi> is not to be vnderſtood, in this laſt clauſe, as it was in the former, becauſe it is put here without the Article? Surely the <hi>Sabellians</hi> ſhall haue nothing to aunſwere, but that which will confirme the diſtinction of the Father, and of the Sonne, as two perſons. But of this, by and by.</p>
            <p>The order of the words in Engliſh, ſhewes the ſenſe; in Greeke it doth not ſo: but that word, which is firſt in place, oftentimes is laſt in the meaning of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſpeaker. <hi>God was the VVord,</hi> ſaith our Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt. Yet <note n="a" place="margin">Baſil. homil. in haec verba Hilar de Trinit. lib. 7.</note> the firſt word <hi>God</hi> in ſenſe followes the laſt, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>The VVord was God:</hi> How ſhall that appeare, ſince the wordes will beare aſwell the one as the other? It ſhall appeare by theſe reaſons. Firſt the queſtion was not of God, whether he were before the beginning of the world or no, for that was neither denied, nor doubted of by Chriſtians, or Heretickes. But the eternall Beeing of our Sauiour Chriſt, and his Godhead were impugned by <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and <hi>Ebion,</hi> which gaue our Euangeliſt ſome occaſion of writing this Goſpell. It was fit therefore, that hee ſhould teach the Church, and confound the Heretickes by ſaying, that <hi>The VVord was God.</hi> Secondly, we haue direction for the expounding of this clauſe, from both the former: wherein <hi>The VVord</hi> is ſtill the firſt part of the ſentence; and looke what is affirmed, it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of the <hi>VVord. The VVord was in the beginning: The VVord was with God;</hi> In like manner, the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, continuing his diſcourſe, muſt needs bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to ſay, <hi>The VVord was God;</hi> which indeede was the very thing, hee meant to auouch of him.

            <p>Wee haue then the true meaning of the holy Ghoſt in theſe words, <hi>The VVord was God. He, that was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and was with God, was alſo himſelfe God.</hi> Here ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a doubt, why the Euangeliſt addeth this clauſe; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Godhead of our Sauiour might be certainly, and neceſſarily concluded out of the two former branches, as it hath manifeſtly appeared in the opening of them. He, that had a being, when as yet there was no creature, and was with God, when there was nothing that was not God, could not poſſibly be any other then God. Why then is it added that <hi>The VVord was God?</hi> Surely (as I take it) to preuent that obiection, which might ariſe in the conceit of ſome; If he were with God, it may ſeeme, that he was not God. To which, the Euangeliſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21009:36"/> thus anſweres in effect. Though he were with God, in reſpect of his perſon; yet, in regard of his nature, hee himſelfe was God. This I graunt was implied in the former: but in a matter of ſo great moment, it pleaſed the holy ſpirit of God to haue a gratious regard of our weakeneſſe, and to ſpeake ſo, as the true<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The point then, which is here deliuered, is this; <hi>Ieſus Christ, the promiſed Meſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And becauſe, the matter is of eſpeciall importance, and no place ſo fit, as this, for the handling of it, I thinke it beſt to follow it ſomewhat largely: the rather becauſe I meane to doe it now once for all; but as occaſion ſhall be offred, for the cleering of ſome textes, here and there, in this Goſpell. The firſt proofe that our Sauiour Chriſt is God, may be taken from thoſe places of Scripture, where the names, that are proper to the true &amp; only God, are giuen to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. For it is out of queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that howſoeuer ſome of thoſe titles are, now and then, aſcribed to men, with ſome addition, or in ſome reſpect; yet no creature is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely called <hi>God, Lord, the moſt high,</hi> or by any other ſuch name. Of all theſe the moſt common, for ordinary vſe, is <hi>God;</hi> which we find ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery leafe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the true God <hi>Iehouah</hi> is ſpoken of.

               </gap> to that, which is more proper to our calling. For as the Angells that are miniſtring ſpirits, though they be faine oftentimes to oppoſe themſelues, againſt the malice and fury of ſatan, &amp; his inſtruments; yet haue not this office properly aſſign'd vnto them, but as it furthereth their principle charge, to helpe them forward which ſhall be heires of ſaluation: ſo the miniſters of the Goſpel muſt account it their eſpecial duty to inſtruct &amp; comfort them that are the true members of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. To you therfore beloued in the ſame our Sauiour, will I now addreſſe my ſpeech, euen to all you, that beleeue in Chriſt to iuſtification. Haue you learned, that the Meſſiah your Sauiour is God almighty? Do you firmly and ſtedfaſtly beleeue this, without wilfull gain-ſaying or doubting? Aſſure your ſelues, the holy Ghoſt hath ſet you in the waie to euerlaſting life. But me thinkes I heare ſome poore ſoule, ſighing in himſelf, &amp; ſtriuing if it were poſſible, to conceale his own thoughts from his own heart. What is it thou doſt ſo labour to ſuppreſſe?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21009:42"/> what art thou ſo affray de to be knowen of?

What? Thoſe, that haue (now and then) ſome doubt in them of his eternall God-head? I: euen thoſe; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of Satan and all his treacherie. Let mee reaſon with thee a little. Doſt thou not beleeue, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the vndoubted word of God? yes: thou dooſt. Art thou not perſwaded, that the ſame Scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth thee, that thy Sauiour Chriſt is very God? Thou art. But thou haſt many times ſome doubting of the point within thy heart. What? Doſt thou doubt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, as one that either thinkes it not to be ſo, or at the leaſt, that was neuer reſolutely perſwaded, that it is ſo? Let me ſay more to thee. Wouldſt thou haue him bee God or no? If thy affection deſire to honour him, all that may be, if thy weake faith labour to ouercome this doubting; Satan would haue thee doubt, &amp; makes thee afraid thou doubteſt, but indeed thou doſt beleeue. It is not a property of the moſt ſanctified men to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tentations, but not to yeelde to them with ioy and liking. True faith may be weake, though perfect faith cannot. Weaknes of faith wil admit occaſion of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but not giue place to doubting. Dooſt thou not finde it in thy ſelfe? thy doubting neither brings forth denying, nor receiues any kinde entertainement at thy hands: then art thou wholly free from wilfull gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, or doubting.</p>
            <p>Satan can not make thee beleeue, that thy Sauiour is not God. Only he makes thee afraid, leaſt he ſhould not be God. And how comes hee to this aduantage? Surely by no other meanes, but by driuing thee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the point by reaſon. There can be but one God:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21009:42"/> which is he, that ſent Ieſus Chriſt into the world, and not Ieſus himſelfe. If thou tell him of the three perſons, hee demaunds further, how thou canſt conceiue, that there ſhould be three ſuch perſons, and all they but one God; As if <note n="p" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>wee walkt heere by ſight, and not by faith.</hi> I know it is poſſible to beate the Deuill at his owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and by the force of reaſon to maintaine againſt him, that there is a Trinity of perſons; though that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, by diſcourſe of reaſon, could neuer be attained to, without reuelation from God. But this is not the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour a Chriſtian truſts to. Thy bulwark muſt bee the ſhield of faith, borne vp, and held out by ſome ſtrong reſt of holy ſcripture. <hi>The word was God:</hi> Saith our E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uangeliſt. <hi>By it were all things made.</hi> Let Satan caſt his fiery, and poyſonous darts againſt vs: This ſhield quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the fury and killeth the ſtrength of their fire and poyſon. As for his diſtinctions and reſpects, wherby he ſweats, and tyres himſelfe to proue, that our Sauiour is but God by fauour, not by nature, becauſe he is imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch an office, not becauſe he is eternally begotten of God his father: they are ſparkles that keepe a crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with more feare, then hurt; and venom that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a few Pimples, in the outer skin, with more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then danger. Keepe thee cloſe vnder the ſhield of faith: and though Satan make thee ſtagger, yet hee ſhall neuer ouerthrow thee.</p>
            <p>Being then thus armed at all points, with an aſſured perſwaſion of our Sauiour Chriſts diuine nature, and hauing beaten the enemy that charged vs with ſuch force and fury; let vs peaceably, and carefully conſider with our ſelues, what vſe wee may haue of that fort which wee now poſſeſſe in ſafety. Is this Sauiour of ours God eternal, infinite in wiſedome, in power, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, in all worth and perfection?

            <p>Now, the ſufficiency of this worthy ſacrifice, ariſeth not from the bloud of man, though it be more excellent then that of buls or goates, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the inualuable worth of the perſon, whoſe blood is ſacrifice. Could the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21009:43"/> bloud of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> of <hi>Abell,</hi> or of <hi>Adam,</hi> while he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and holy, haue beene a ſufficient ranſome for ſinne, committed againſt the infinite maieſtie of God? Looke how much it lacks of infiniteneſſe in valew, ſo much it lacks alſo of worth to make ſatiſfaction. For no finit ſum can diſcharge an infinit debt. But as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo ſin againſt God is infinit. Multiply any finit nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ber, though neuer ſo great, that which proceeds of it wil be but finit. And whatſoeuer is finite (imagine it as great as you can in number or meaſure) is no neerer infinitnes, then the leaſt point or fraction, that can bee conceiued. For there is no kinde of proportion betwixt them: elſe ſhould finit &amp; infinit be al one. Becauſe that which hath any part of it finit, being compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of finite parts put together, muſt of neceſſity it ſelfe be vnderſtood to bee finite. For the parts make the whole: and that taketh it nature from theſe. Now, who knows not that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and nature of man is finit? Such therfore would the whole lumpe bee, if all that is, or can bee in al men, were gathered together into one. How then can a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which is but finite, make due ſatiſfaction for ſin, that is infinite? And that, which I ſpeake of men, I would haue vnderſtood alſo, of all creatures whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer, Angels or other. For ſince their nature and worth is finit, it is as farre from infiniteneſſe (be what it will in compariſon of the valew of other finite things) as no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing is from all; that which is, from that which is not.</p>
            <p>There is then nothing at all left, wherein wee may haue any truſt, or hope of hauing ſatiſfaction made to God for vs, but onely the inualuable ſacrifice of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 10. 14</note> 
               <hi>VVho with one offering hath con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified.</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21009:44"/> ſacrifice was ſufficient; and that ſerues my turne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further adoe. Oh my brethren: let vs not be ſo vnkind to our bleſſed ſauiour, ſo vnthankfull to God the father, ſo contemptuous againſt the holy ghoſt, ſo retchleſſe of our owne ſaluation. Is it not monſtrous vnkindneſſe, to haue ſo incompatable a fauour done thee, and not to labour to know that, which is moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to him that did it? How ſhalt thou worthily lift vp thy heart to praiſe, and magnifie the Father that ſent his ſonne for thy redemption, if thou neglect to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how glorious he was, whom hee ſent? At the leaſt deſpiſe not the wiſedome, and prouidence of the holy ſpirit: as if hee had troubled himſelfe in vain, with ſetting his Secretaries on worke to pen the particulars of thy ſaluation, for thy full ſatiſfaction and comfort. Well, let all this goe: If thou beeſt not aſhamed of ſo vnreaſonable vnkindneſſe, vnthankfulneſſe, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe; yet bee afraid, leaſt thou loſe that, which thou thinkeſt thou haſt. Art thou ſo grounded and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in aſſurance of ſufficient ſatiſfaction made by Chriſt, that it is vnpoſſible thou ſhouldſt be (I will not ſay caſt downe, but) ſhaken? Take heed this conceit of thine, bee not like that of the Phariſe, <note n="d" place="margin">Luke. 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Lord I thanke thee, that I am not like other men.</hi> Looke about thee on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide, and behold the ſpirituall battaile, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.</p>
            <p>Take a view how thy fellow ſouldiers are intreated. Thou maiſt ſee many a one, that hath bin as confident as thou art, and yet now is to ſeeke for comfort. Belike thou haſt had hitherto either no aſſault at all, or but ſome weake battery againſt thy ſoule. If thou be once wholly charg'd, and hardly purſued, thou wilt find thy ſelfe to ſtand in need of all the ayde, that may poſſibly bee had. Then thou wilt begin to ſee, and feele, that if Chriſt were not God, thy truſt in him might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiue thee. Be wiſe therefore, and while thou haſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21009:44"/> fayre weather, prouide for the ſtorme, that eyther is comming, or may come: leaſt if it fall vpon thee, and take thee vnprouided, it driue thee on the rocks of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, to the wracke or hazard of thy pretious ſoule.</p>
            <p>But I am perſwaded better things of you my brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, that you hunger, and thirſt after the word of God the food of your ſoules: that you long to vnde ſtand the myſtery of your glorious redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that you think nothing vnworthy your learning, which the H. Ghoſt hath thought worthy of his teaching. Let vs proceede then, in the feare of God: you, with this reſolution in your ſelues; I, with this perſwaſion of you. Wee ſee with what excellent wiſdome our holy Euangeliſt hath begunne his Goſpell; and we find our ſelues as it were double arm'd by this bleſſed inſtruction, againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, that would corrupt our iudgement, and againſt Satan that would ouerthrow our faith. Hearken not to either of theſe, at any hand: but reſt thy ſelfe ſtedfaſtly vpon the authority of the holy Ghoſt, who telles thee plainly and truly, that <hi>The word was God.</hi> Being ſetled in this beliefe, thou art prepared againſt the aſſaults of the diuell, when hee ſhall marſhall thy ſinnes againſt thee, and charge thee with them. The greatneſſe of ſin cannot make any man deſpaire, that knows the price of his redemption to be the bloud of God infinit in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew. The more Satan extolleth the iuſtice of God, the more he doth aſſure vs of ſaluation. For ſince the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which was made for vs, is ſo ineſtimable, the iuſter God is, the more he holdes himſelfe ſatisfied. If wee had to deale with an vniuſt tyran, that regarded not iuſtice &amp; equity, whatſoeuer our ſatisfaction were, wee could hardly be out of danger. But our moſt iuſt God, that valewes all things aright, finding the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be ſufficient, cleerly acquites all them, for whom it was offred; yea, holds himſelf ſo fully contented, that he will neuer remember their tranſgreſſions any more.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21009:45"/> But of this matter, and of this verſe enough. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the next.</p>

Yet to make a cleere way to the interpretation of them, we muſt conſider to what the firſt worde <hi>This</hi> belongeth: and alſo how this verſe dependeth on the former; The originall Greeke giues vs iuſt occaſion of this in quiry, becauſe in it <hi>This</hi> may be referred either <hi>to the word,</hi> or to <hi>God.</hi> The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh affords the like cauſe of doubting, though the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin do not. But this queſtion is eaſily anſwered, that the Euangeliſt meanes <hi>this word</hi> &amp; not <hi>this God.</hi> For neither was there any reaſon to ſay, This God was with God; vnderſtanding that, in the laſt clauſe, it ſignified the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature: and if it note the perſon, out of doubt the Euangeliſt would neuer haue cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged his former ſpeech, being ſo plaine &amp; eaſie, for a doubtfull, &amp; hard word.

            <p>The other queſtion is a great deale harder. I will bee as ſhort, and plaine, as the matter will let me. I ſay then that this ſecond verſe maie bee either a repetition, and expoſition of the pointes (all or ſome) formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>

Both that the Heretikes might ſee and acknowledge their error, and that the faithfull might the better be confirmed in the truth, which they ſaw doubled, and as it were twice confirmed by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But if this repetition bring alſo an expoſition with it, who ſees not the neceſſity and profit of it? What is there then to be learned by the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:21009:46"/> muſt be added to the ſecond clauſe, or vnderſtood with it. How much eaſier might it haue bin ſet down in the place, to which it properly belonged, if there had been any need thereof?</p>
            <p>There <note n="f" place="margin">Tertullian. con.

But this expoſition alſo was needleſſe. For where could he be conceiv'd to be, but with God, when as there was nothing, but God? As for the time of his incarnation, the Euangeliſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that afterward, where hee ſayth, <hi>The VVord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi>

I would not trouble you with this diuerſity of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but that I am deſirous, now in the beginning, both to ſpeake fully of ſuch matters, as concerne the God-head of our Sauiour, and the holy Trinity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to giue you ſom direction, by example, how to iudge of the expoſitions of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Let vs ſee now what new matter we may gather out of this verſe, if it be not intended as a repetition. Firſt, it ſerues to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe Heretickes, who fondly and lewdly teach, that there are two Wordes: one which is indeed, as it were, in God; the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, or not vnited to him. The former (ſay they) was not the Meſſiah, but the later: and of the former, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh in the beginning of this Goſpell. It is hard to ſay, whether this conceit be more blaſphemous, or more abſurd. What is it, but blaſphemy, to denie, that our Sauiour is the ſame God with the Father? And what is more abſurde, then to dreame of two Words, without anie inkling of ſuch a matter giuen by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt?

From which, the Euangeliſt paſſeth to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of (why ſhould I doubt to ſay ſo?) the ſame <note place="margin">Ver. 14</note> Word. <hi>And the VVord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>became fleſh.</hi> Be not ſo vnreaſonable, as to imagin, that the holy Ghoſt would make a diſcourſe in ſo many verſes of one Word, and vpon a ſodaine fal into a new matter of an other Word, neuer heard of, neuer thought of before.

               </gap> ſpeech was, if our Euangeliſt now firſt begin to write of him whome only his Goſpell dooth concerne. But what doe I ſpend time in refuting ſuch abſurdities? It is one and the ſame Word, that was in the beginning with God, &amp; that, in due time, took fleſh of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> his mother.</p>
            <p>But theſe heretickes make ſhewe of proofe, for that they ſay; as if they were blaſphemous with reaſon. If Chriſt (ſay they) be that Word of the Father; ſince the Father and the Word are of the ſame ſubſtance, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21009:47"/> alſo muſt be the word. Firſt this makes no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Sauiours being the Word, then againſt the the other Word, which you fancy to your ſelues. For the Father, and that Word alſo, by the like reaſon, muſt be one word, becauſe they are one in ſubſtance, that is one God, and yet not one Word; becauſe to bee the word, is a propertie belonging to the perſon, not to the nature or ſubſtance of God; as it ſhall appeare God willing, when I handle the Doctrine of the Trinitie. They add, that <hi>the word</hi> being as it were made by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt needes differ from the word which is ſpoken, for the making or producing of it; wilfully refuſing to vnderſtand, that although the act of ſpeaking, and the word that is ſpoken be diſtinct, each from other; yet there are not two Words, but one; namely that which is formed by ſpeaking. The Father doth not ſpeake one word, by which the ſecond is framed; but by ſpeaking frames, &amp; begets the Word. Laſtly whereas they tel vs, that the word, which our Sauiour ſaith hee kept, and which the Iewes heard of him, was not all one with Chriſt himſelfe, they ſay true, but nothing to purpoſe. For that worde was not any thing vnited in nature to God, but the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, which is ordinarily in the Scripture called the word of God. As for their groſſe &amp; abſurd conceite, that the Word meant by our Sauiour in ſuch ſpeeches of his, ſhould be I knowe not what ſpeaking in him, as it were a ſpirit in a body poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, it is fitter to be laught at, then laboured againſt. For how is our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid, <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh 8. 55.</note> 
               <hi>to keepe the worde of God,</hi> which is the place which theſe fonde Heretikes bring? By hauing it ſhut vp within him, as it were in priſon? &amp; not rather by remembring, and dooing that, which God enioyneth? The other place they alleage is no leſſe abſurd. <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 24.</note> 
               <hi>The word, that yee heare, is not mine, but the Fathers that ſent me.</hi> Is it not euident, that our Sauiour means the word ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the word that I ſpeak? So ſpake <note place="margin">verſe 23.</note> he before. <hi>If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will loue me, he wil keepe my word.</hi> And
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21009:47"/> immediatly before the words, they bring, <hi>Hee that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me not, keepeth not my word;</hi> then followeth, <hi>And that word, which you heare, is not mine.</hi> Hee ſhould rather haue ſaid in your ſenſe. <hi>And it is I, that you heare ſpeaking.</hi> But to conclude this point, that which our Sauior ſaith here of the word, he ſpeaks in another place of his doctrine. <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 16.</note> 
               <hi>My doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi> Thus much and indeed too much for this ſottiſh hereſie.</p>
            <p>It is alſo gathered from hence by ſome, that the word is coeternall or equal to the Father in eternity. A doctrin very true, &amp; needfull to be knowne; but ſuch as was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified before, when it was ſaid that <hi>The VVord was in the beginning,</hi> &amp; that <hi>it was with God.</hi> Neither doth <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> in this or the former clauſe note eternity, but the time, when all things began to be created. Wherfore to ſhut vp the interpretation of this verſe with ſhewing what I concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to be intended in it, by the holy ghoſt; I am perſwaded, that the purpoſe of the Evangeliſt was to repeate that, which in the former verſe he had deliuered. For if he had mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to add a fourth point of the like kind to the other 3; in all liklyhood, he would haue continued the ſame manner of writing, by coupling this to that, which went before, and haue ſaid; <hi>And this was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with God.</hi> If any man obiect, that he doth not ſo in that which followeth: he is already anſwered, that in the next words the Evangeliſt comes to a new kinde of argument, wherby he proues that, which before hee had avoucht: namely that the word was in the beginning, &amp; was God, At the leaſt he deſcribes the Word by outward effects towards the creatures, not by his owne nature or properties. Neither is this a bare repetition, but a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner inſtruction for the ſimpleſt, that they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ground of this interpretation, is taken from that place in <note n="m" place="margin">Pro. 8. 22.</note> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs, where this ſame Word is deſcribed by the name of wiſdom. There firſt his eternal Being is deſcribed, <note place="margin">Verſe 30</note> 
               <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his waie.

            <p>His <hi>nouriſhing</hi> as ſome expound it, his <hi>creating</hi> or <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all things,</hi> the holy Ghoſt heere expreſſeth at large, in the words following, <hi>By him were al things made.</hi> The conference of theſe two places ſeemes to warrant this expoſition, as we haue ſeene. I wil not ſtriue much about it; ſo wee apply this repetition to the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our fayth. Concerning our Sauiour Chriſts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall God-head, doubtleſſe we attaine to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing intended by the holy Ghoſt. And of that point, what Chriſtian can doubt, though he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo faine? Doſt thou not perceiue, that the holie E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt deliuers it with aduiſe and deliberation? It is not a matter, that hee hits vpon, but a point choſen by him, to begin his Goſpell withal. It ſlips not from him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21009:48"/> at vnawares: but is repeated, vpon good aduiſement. Certainly this doubling of the point, makes it manifeſt, that the holy ghoſt would haue vs view and conſider it throughly on al ſides. It is neither of ſmall importance, that it need not to be learned; nor eaſie to be beleeued, that it need not to be taught but once. Wherefore is it propounded, and repeated, but that it might be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and remembred? Vnderſtood, that no hereticks deceiue vs; remembred, that our hearts faynt not: Hee, that is God Almighty hath redeemed vs: who ſhall bee able to hold vs Captiues? Let vs not be afraid to defye ſin, hel, death and the deuil himſelfe? <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8. 31.</note> God is on our ſide: who can be againſt vs?</p>
            <p>Hauing thus expounded theſe two verſes, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them ſome poynts, which concerne the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Doctrin of the moſt glorious, and holy Trinity; ſo many things alſo, beeing ſpoken euery where, in this goſpel, of the Father, the Son, and the holy Spirit: I haue thought it neceſſarie, both ſor your inſtruction, and the diſcharge of my dutie, to beſtow the reſt of this hower in opening that bleſſed myſtery. Wherein (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of our Euangeliſt, &amp; the whole courſe of the ſcripture) I will content my ſelfe with the Euidence of the word, without the curioſity of ſchoole diuinity. It ſhall be ſufficient for vs vnderſtand, that the ſcripture affirmeth, that there is one God, and three perſons, though we can ſee no reaſon how it can be ſo: And farder, in ſhewing that the three perſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed diſtinct one from another, and not diuers reſpects of one and the ſame. I will not ſtand vpon their nature in themſelues, ſo much as vpon thoſe effects, which beeing aſcrib'd to them in the Scripture, cannot, as in ſhall appeare, bee performed by anie one perſon. Our Euangeliſt deliuers the point of our Sauiours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature in a few words here in the beginning of the Goſpell. Hee proues it at large by many wonderfull
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21009:49"/> works of his, through the whole courſe of his writing. This ſhal be my example and warrant. Yet I would not haue any man think, that I either condemne their paines and care, who haue laboured to explaine theſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by the light of reaſon, or affirme, that the points themſelues cannot ſtand with reaſon. They are indeed aboue reaſon, but yet not againſt reaſon. As the light of nature, cannot diſcerne them: ſo it cannot diſproue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the chiefe end of them, that endeuoured to diſcuſſe theſe maters, in ſome ſort by reaſon, was rather to ſtop their mouths, that would not beleeue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to inforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beleeue. Now this courſe, in this place and auditorie (I truſt) is needleſſe; I am ſure with the greateſt part it would be bootleſſe. For how many, or rather how few are there heere preſent, that are able to examine; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſubtill arguments that haue been deuiſed, and vſed in theſe queſtions? Neither are wee to ſettle our faith by the waight of humane reaſon, but to ground it vpon diuine authority. Now to the matter.</p>
            <p>Wherein, that I may proceede the more orderly, and be the more eaſily vnderſtood; Firſt I will ſpeake of the vnity of the godhead, that there is but one God; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly of the Trinity of the perſons. Where, the firſt poynt muſt be to proue, that there are three perſons; the ſecond, to ſhew how they are diſtinguiſht one from an other. And becauſe there is in our Church ſeruice a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to this purpoſe, knowne in part to all, that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, commonly called the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who like a valiant champion maintein'd the godhead of Chriſt, againſt the Aſſaults of <hi>Arius,</hi> I will referre you from point to point to that diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>That there is but one God, the ſame one God witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe in ſcripture. <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 20. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt haue none other Gods but me.</hi> Which is not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpoken, as if ſome one God would haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the reſt; but enioyned with authority by him
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21009:49"/> who onely had right to claime ſuch preheminence. Els, neither had he done done iuſtly, that gaue this charge (and how ſhould he be conceiu'd to be God, that is knowne to be vniuſt) and the Iewes to whom he gaue it, ſhould haue hurt themſelues as much, by diſpleaſing all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods, whom they refuſed to acknowledge, as help themſelues by pleaſing that one, whome they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. Vnleſle perhaps wee may ridiculouſly think, that for quietnes ſake, the other Gods were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to put vp this iniury, or that they were all agreed to part ſtakes, as the heathen abſurdly feyne of their three Gods. Whereof <hi>Iupiter</hi> the eldeſt took heauen for his ſhare, <hi>Neptune</hi> the ſecond got the gouernment of the Sea, and <hi>Pluto</hi> the yongeſt, rather then he would ſit out quite, was content to play ſmall game (as we ſay) and to take Hell for his part rather then nothing. Theſe are liker fancies of men in a dreame, then diſcourſes of learned writers. And yet neither could theſe three bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers well agree at all times: and to ſay the truth, <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whom the other two aknowledged for their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, was the onely God, in the Iudgement of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. But whatſoeuer they imagined, wee are ſure our God doth ſo ſpeake of himſelfe, <note n="p" place="margin">Deut. 32. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Behold now: for I am he, and there is no Gods with me.</hi> That appeares by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; <hi>I kill</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; giue life, I wound and I make whole.</hi> Are not theſe the works of god? In whoſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are death &amp; life, but in Gods? But hath this God only that power? Are there not other, that haue it, aſwell as he? No ſure: as himſelfe addeth; There is none <hi>that can deliuer out of my hands.</hi> Thus he ſpeaketh of himſelfe: thus the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Moſes</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 33. 11.</note> that talked with him face to face, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of him; <hi>Vnto thee it was ſhew'd</hi>

               <hi>there is none other.</hi> I might recken vp many like teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But whom will not theſe content, if enough will content him?</p>
            <p>Will any fooliſh blaſphemer now except againſt theſe proofes, as if they were to be vnderſtood of the general nature of God, not of any one, who onely is God? how fond and abſurd muſt ſuch an exception needs bee! ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men know by reaſon, that generalls haue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reall being, diuers from the ſpecials, or <hi>ſpecies,</hi> nor can be ſaid to perform any particular action. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (to make the matter as plaine as I can) Man, as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that nature, which is common, or generall to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſeuerall man, is not any thing ſubſiſting by itſelfe, but hath it whole being in the particulars of that kind. Therefore alſo it cannot be ſaid, that the generall nature of man doth reaſon or ſpeake; but that this, or that man doth ſo. But God ſaith, <hi>I kill &amp; giue life:</hi> neither can the general nature, which is leudly &amp; abſurdly conceiv'd, ſay truely of itſelfe; <hi>Behold I am hee, and there are no gods with me;</hi> neither were ſuch a ſpeech to any purpoſe or of any vſe: as if it were to bee thought that any man could imagin, that there are more, then one general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any one kinde. There is then but one God only. For if there were more, God could not ſay, <hi>there are no more:</hi> euen as <hi>Adam,</hi> after <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were borne, could not affirme, That he alone was man, and that there was none beſide him.</p>
            <p>The ſame trueth is confirmed in the new Teſtament by the <note n="ſ" place="margin">

Wherefore (to ſpeake plainely, rather then artificially) it may pleaſe you firſt to bee perſwaded, that although the word perſon, bee not in the Scripture applyed to the <hi>Father the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt:</hi> yet euerie one of them is ſo deſcribed therein, that wee may, and muſt needes conceiue him to bee a perſon, according as wee vnderſtand the word. Firſt, who knowes not, that there is no perſon. but where there is a nature, that hath reaſon and vnderſtanding. For no man euer calles any creature, that is not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reaſon; by the name of a perſon. Who will, or may ſay of tenne or twentie Lions, Horſes, Oxen, Apes, or any creatures of the like kinde, that there are tenne or twentie perſons? For example, if wee haue a denne, or a ſtall, that will receiue tenne Lions, or tenne Oxen: no man will ſay, ſuch a denne or ſtall will holde tenne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But if there bee a Table, whereat tenne men may ſit, it is an vſuall ſpeech, to ſay, it will holde tenne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. So that firſt to the being of a Perſon, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21009:51"/> that the thing, which wee call a Perſon, bee by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indued with reaſon: otherwiſe, it cannot by any meanes be a perſon. Secondly, wee are farther to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the word perſon notes vnto vs ſome one of that kinde, and not many conſidered together. For, it were abſurd to ſay of thoſe tenne men before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, though neceſſarily they haue euerie one of them, the vſe of reaſon, that they are a Perſon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore by Perſon wee meane any one of ſuch a kinde. Euery man, euery woman, euery childe is a perſon; becauſe euery one of them hath vnderſtanding by nature, and is ſeuerall or diſtinct by himſelfe, from al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that no other man, woman, or child in the world in heauen or in earth, is or can be the ſame perſon. Some man perhaps will imagin, that thoſe qualities, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are no where to bee found, but where firſt there is reaſon, as iuſtice, wiſedome, temperance, forti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude, and ſuch like, may bee tearmed Perſons; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince euerie one of theſe, is ſeuerall from other. But that cannot bee: becauſe whatſoeuer is a Perſon muſt depend on nothing as a part or property therof, but muſt be intire of it ſelfe. None of theſe qualities are ſuch: but all of them haue their being in ſome one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or other. <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſedom, and <hi>Samſons</hi> ſtrengt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let the wiſedome of the one, and the fortitude of the other be turned into folly and Cowardiſe, yet ſhal each of them be ſtill a perſon, as before he was: yea, if there were no more Men, Women, nor Children in the world, but they two or either of them: yet ſhould they both, if both continued, or the one of them, if the one continued, bee two perſons or one perſon. So then to the being of a Perſon it is required, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that the thing bee of ſuch a kinde, as hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That euery one of them is God, it hath been manifeſtly proued; and no leſſe, that there is but one God. Whereupon it muſt neceſſarily follow, that they are all three, not three Gods, but one God.

It remaines, that I ſhould ſpeake of the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the three perſons; onely ſo farre, as to make vs vnderſtand, wherein that diſtinction conſiſts. For the better conceiuing whereof, wee may ſay, in one word, that the manner of being, which each perſon hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelfe, is that, by which they are diſtinguiſhed; in all other things, there is no reall diſtinction of any one of them, from another. The very names them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which are giuen to them ſeuerally in Scripture, point to the diſtinction, that is amongſt them. The Father, as euery man knowes, in that hee is a Father, or, as hee is a Father, is conceiv'd to bee of himſelfe, and to giue being to his Sonne. Conſider <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, without looking backe to his creation, by which he had his being from God: but, looke onely forward as hee was his Son <hi>Abels</hi> Father: Do you not plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, that <hi>Adam</hi> thus conſidered, is author o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>May wee reaſonably affirme the like of the Sonne?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21009:54"/> Surely, as hee is God, there can nothing be ſayd or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of the Father, but may truely and muſt nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſarily bee ſpoken, and thought of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt ſeuerally, aſwel as of the Father: wherin then lies the diſtinction? Euery man can readily anſwer, In his manner of being, or in his being the Sonne. Take the former example. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> are both men, &amp; in reſpect of their humane nature, there is no difference betwixt them. What then? Is there none at all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? yes ſure: <hi>Adam</hi> hath not his being of any other, as hee is a Father; <hi>Abell</hi> hath his, as hee is a Sonne, of his Father <hi>Adam.</hi> Let it not trouble you, that I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a difference betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abell,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no difference, but onely a diſtinction betwixt God the Father and the Sonne: the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abell</hi> are, as two perſons, ſo two men: God <note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> the Father, and God the Sonne are indeede two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but not two Gods. Wee ſee then, that the Father, is truely and really a diſtinct perſon from the Sonne: who though hee be <hi>neither made, nor created</hi> by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet is <hi>begotten of him;</hi> and ſo hath not his being of himſelfe, but of his father, and therefore, in the manner of his being, is diſtinguiſht from the Father.</p>
            <p>So is the holy Ghoſt, or ſpirit from both of them. You wil aske me, by what he is diſtinguiſht from them. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> by his proceeding from them. Firſt, it is manifeſt he is diſtinct from the father; becauſe he is not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in regard of his perſon, as the father is. Secondly, although he agree with the Sonne, in that each of them hath his being from a Third, namely the Father; yet in the particular maner of his being, he is diſtinguiſht fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. For the Sonne is begotten by the Father, &amp; ſo hath his being: but the holy Ghoſt is not begotten, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth. From whome doth the holy Ghoſt proceed?

               <hi>All thine are mine.</hi> The later of theſe two Texts may be vnderſtood (I grant) of thoſe things that are (as wee ſpeake) without God: but becauſe it hath vſually beene applyed to proue this point, I thought fit to alleadge it. You will reply, that all the Fathers, is not the Sons; That perſonall property, whereby he is the Sonne, is not the Fathers, but the Sonnes: &amp; that, by which the Father is the Father, is not the Sonnes, but the Fathers. Whatſoeuer elſe the Father hath, the Sonne hath alſo. But that the holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father, is not the perſonall property of the Father; and therefore the Sonne hath that, and ſo with the Father, as it were by breathing, produceth the holy Ghoſt: who therfore is called the ſpirit of the Sonne, and of Chriſt, <note n="q" place="margin">Gal 46.</note> 
               <hi>God hath ſent the ſpirit of his Sonne into your hearts. If any man <note n="r" place="margin">Rom 89.</note> haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not Chriſtes.</hi> It is not ſaid indeed, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Sonne, as it is, that he proceedeth from the Father: but ſince he is called the ſpirit of the Sonne, as wel as of the Father, wee truely gather, that hee proceedeth no leſſe from the Sonne, then from the Father, though the one be expreſt, and the other be not.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, we ſee what the properties are, by which the perſons are diſtinguiſht among themſelues; <hi>The Father begetteth, &amp; neither is begotten, nor proceedeth: the Sonne is begotten, but proceedeth not: the holy Ghoſt neither begetteth, nor is begotten, but proceedeth.</hi> All theſe 3. <hi>He that begetteth, He that is begotten, and He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:21009:55"/> are all one and the ſame God, to bee bleſſed and praiſed for euer and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi> Therefore are all 3 ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely equall in all matters, appertaining to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God: only there are 2 things, wherein the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath as it were ſome praeeminence among the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The one I noted by the way before; that <hi>He is of himſelfe:</hi> ſo is neither of the other, but both are of him. The other is, that <hi>the father is the firſt in order;</hi> &amp;, in theſe reſpects, he is ſometime called by <hi>Diuines</hi> the fountaine <note place="margin">v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas it is ſaid in that Creed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> named, that <hi>None of the 3 perſons is afore or after other;</hi> the meaning is, that none of them is in time afore or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Verſe. 26.</note> other, all being eternall, as the next verſe ſheweth: ſaying, that <hi>All 3 are coeternall,</hi> that is alike eternall. The Sonne alſo hath the like preaeminence aboue the holy Ghoſt. For both he is in order before him, beeing the ſecond: and the holy Ghoſt is of him, as well as of the Father. But theſe praeeminences concerne the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which are diſtinct, not the diuine nature, which is wholly &amp; abſolutely one; as by which, theſe 3 perſons are one God.

               </gap>th the Euangeliſt make choiſe of this kind of ſpeech, and not rather, ſay plainely, as he might, <hi>He made all things?</hi> It is, and hath bin alwaies commonly held, that this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking doth better ſet out the worke of the Creation, and confirme that former point of doctrine, whereby our Sauiour was affirmed to bee the ſonne of God. If it had bin ſaid, that <hi>The VVord created all things,</hi> it might haue bin imagined, that the Father had had no hand therein: whereas now it is implyed, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made all things by the Sonne. But ſurely (ſauing their better iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that thus reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) there is no more feare leaſt the father ſhoulde bee thought not to haue created the world, becauſe the ſonne did, then leaſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhould by the ſame ſpeech be imagined to haue had nothing to do therein: &amp; it is as much againſt the truth of religion to deny or doubt of the Godhead of the holy Ghoſt, as of the fathers being God. Yea, the daunger was greater, concerning the holy Ghoſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not only the Scripture doth more often aſcribe that worke of creation to the Father, then to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: but alſo the generall opinion of al men makes the father a Creator, whereas the diuine nature of the holy Ghoſt is not ſo commonly knowne or beleeued. Neither will this kind of ſpeech, which our Euangeliſt here vſeth, though you take it neuer ſo largely, preuent or remedy that doubt, touching the worke of the holy Ghoſt in the Creation; but that for ought, that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be implied in this phraſe <hi>By him,</hi> the ſpirit may be thought to be no creator. But (that I may omit nothing which may be gathered for our inſtruction, out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſonable obſeruation) let vs a little conſider, how this manner of ſpeaking, may confirme our faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Sauiour Chriſts being of his father.

               </gap> ſpeech vſually imply any ſuch matter; nor the other exclude any that are, or may be held to haue bin doers therein. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are faine to adde only or alone, when we would haue it conceiu'd, that ſome one was the dooer of this, or that. But let vs grant, that <hi>By him</hi> ſignifieth alſo the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Father, that wee maye come to the cheefe thing intended by that obſeruation. What if all thinges be made by the Sonne? We muſt learne thereby that the Sonne hath all that he hath, from the Father, and not of himſelfe. The father is ſaid to haue made all things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is of himſelfe: All things are ſaid to be made by the ſonne, for that he is of another. I propound theſe things to your conſideration, not ſo much with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Euangeliſt had any ſuch meaning, as for the ſatiſfaction of ſome, who think it not lawfull to leaue any thing vntaught, which hath beene formerly obſerv'd, and deliuered for truth. And I doe it the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener now in this beginning, that I may rather bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed hereafter, for leauing that out of my expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath no certaine euidence of truth, nor great likelihood of reaſon. Wherefore I will (for the moſt part) content my ſelfe, with the alleaging, and refuting of ſuch interpretations onely, as the heretikes, Papiſts, and other, haue made for the avowing of ſome of their errors. For the preſent, to cleare that, which I haue begunne to ſpeake of, the doctrine of our Sauiours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing his being from his Father, yea the very power of creating, if you conſider him as a Sonne, is true, and ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For being ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidred, he is wholly of the Father,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21009:57"/> and hath nothing of himſelfe; that wee may not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a needleſſe, &amp; fruitleſſe controuerſie, begune ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly by ſome Papiſts and ignorantly, as I ſhewed in my laſt exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, concerning the Godhead of the Sonne. But this Doctrine cannot neceſſarily be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this kind of phraſe. But if our Euangeliſt had intended any ſuch thing, hee would haue ſaid, that the Father made all things by the Sonne: as <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>By whome alſo he made the world:</hi> and not thus vncertainely, and to ſuch a purpoſe obſcurely, <hi>By him all things were made;</hi> Eſpecially, ſince the ſame ſpeech may truely be vttered euen of God the Father, or of the Diuine nature, in which all three Perſons are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. I doe therefore rather perſwade my ſelfe, that the Euangeliſt vſed his libertie: and whereas hee might ſay either <hi>He made all things, or By him all things were made,</hi> he did make choiſe of the later, both for variety, and for elegancy of ſpeech. He had ſpoken of the Word altogether as yet after one maner of phraſe; <hi>The Word was:</hi> that he now varies, ſaying not <hi>He made,</hi> but <hi>By him were made:</hi> and this ſuiteth with the next verſe very fitly, <hi>By him were all things made, In him was life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no queſtion, but that this making, which the Euangeliſt here noteth, was the creating of the world, whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh. And how ſoeuer it is a common opinion, that creating ſignifieth making without any matter, whereof the things to bee created ſhould be made, whereas making preſuppoſeth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ready to be framed, and formed; yet indeed there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hardly be any ſuch diſtinction wrung out of the words themſelues. For neither hath the Hebrew, that <hi>Moſes</hi> vſeth, to ſet out the creation, any ſuch nature, nor the Greeke, by which it is tranſlated. For the former, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth manifeſtly by the ordinary vſe of it in the Scripture, and namely by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe; who applies the word <hi>making</hi> to that, which in in the next verſe he cals

Surely man was not created, being made of the duſt, if there be no creating, where there is matter of which he is to bee made. So it is alſo affirmed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 21.</note> that <hi>God created the great whales:</hi> what of nothing? Nothing leſſe. It is well knowne, and recorded euen there by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the water brought them forth. I wil ſay more. There is no one place in the hiſtory of the creation. where the worde <hi>Creating</hi> maye be taken, (I doe not ſay muſt bee, but may bee taken) for making of nothing, except perhaps the firſt verſe, <hi>In the beginuing God created heauen, and earth:</hi> only here may the word be ſo vnderſtood, becauſe by heauen &amp; earth, the firſt matter of all things may be conceiued; which only was created of nothing, all things elſe of it. As for the greeke, both the vſe of it in al kind of writers ſpeaketh for me: &amp; who can imagin, that they who did not beleeue, that euer there was any creation, ſhoulde deuiſe a needleſſe word to ſignifie ſuch a thing, as they neuer dreamt of and if at any time they ſpeake of ſuch a queſtion, they expreſſe themſelues, by adding ſome worde to <hi>make;</hi> as <hi>to make of nothing,</hi> or <hi>without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent matter,</hi> or ſuch like.</p>
            <p>What then? Doe wee deny the thing, becauſe wee ſay there is no word, that neceſſarily ſignifieth <hi>To make of nothing?</hi> God forbid. We haue taught, and can eaſily proue, if neede be, that all things, beſides God, haue had
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21009:58"/> a beginning of their being. Then were they ether made of nothing, which indeed is moſt true, or of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelfe, as the matter of them. But the later is meerely vnpoſſible. For neither is God of any bodily matter, as we ſee thoſe thinges to be; <note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 4. 24.</note> 
               <hi>God is a ſpirit:</hi> and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is of his ſubſtance, is the ſame God with him, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit in power, and being: whereas all creatures are finit, in both. Therefore when we meditate on the glorious worke of creation, wee muſt drawe our thoughts from the cogitation of theſe things, which we ſee, feel, heare, ſmell, and taſt, and conceiue aſwell, as we can, that there is nothing, but God. How then came all theſe to be, the world, and the creatures therein? God made them. Of what? Of that firſt matter, which was without forme, couered all ouer with darkneſſe. But whereof was that firſt matter made? Of nothing. That is, when as yet there was nothing at all, but the in comprehenſible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of God, in his eternall being, it pleaſed him to wil that all theſe things ſhould be: and by this will of his, &amp; according to this will, all, and every one of theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs took their being. Firſt, as God had from all eternity purpoſed, and willed, that firſt matter, or lump, had its being, ſimply of nothing, as all reaſon ſhewes vs. For how is it poſſible to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue, or imagin, that that, which is the firſt matter, ſhould haue any other matter before it, of which it might be made?

So then if you aſke me, what that was, which was made of nothing; I ſay, the firſt matter of all things, and in which all creatures were contained. If any man be afraid, leaſt this opinion ſhould deminiſh the glory of God, in creating the particulars; hee muſt be put in mind, that both the matter it ſelfe was made by God of nothing, &amp; that all the creatures were made

            <p>It remaines, that wee expounde the laſt words, <hi>All things.</hi> What need they any expoſition, may ſome man ſay. For who is ſo dull, that he vnderſtands not, what is meant by them? what can be meant, but abſolutely <hi>All things,</hi> without exception? Surely it is certaine, that the Euangeliſts meaning is ſo; and a man may well maruell that there ſhould be any queſtion made of it: yet ſuch hath bin the malice of Satan, and the miſerable ſhifting of Hereticks, that (I thinke) no one text in this whole Goſpell, hath bin more ſtrangely, or diuerſly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

But what ſhould I enter into any refutation of theſe Heretickes? All I meane to doe in ſuch caſes, is to cleare the Text from ſuch errors, as they loade it withall.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21009:61"/> blaſphemies, and abſurdities. Is the world euill by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and not rather wholly by corruption? Or is there any thing in the worlde ſo euill, that it hath not ſome good, &amp; profitable vſe? Is it poſſible any thing ſhould haue a being, but from <hi>Iehouah,</hi> the author of all being? But, I knowe not how, I am almoſt ſlipt into a refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that, which deſerues rather to be reiected with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, then refuted by reaſon; eſpecially ſeeing the ground of this their building, is ſo ſleight and ſandy. What colour is there for this interpretation of theyrs? If wee take the words, in the plaine ſenſe they afford vs, they containe neither impietie, nor abſurdity. What then? Doth the circumſtance of the place require anye ſuch expoſition? Nay rather ot confutes it, as I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. Neither doe they brag of any ſpeciall reuelation, for the vnderſtanding of it. What ſhould then be their reaſon for it? Imagin what you will, or can, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit paſſeth all abſurdity. Forſooth, the Euangeliſt hath ſet <hi>nothing,</hi> in the laſt place, after <hi>was made.</hi> O incredible, ſhall I ſay ignorance, or wilfull blindneſſe? As if for the ſenſe, it were not all one to ſay, <hi>without him was made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> and, <hi>without him nothing was made.</hi> In Engliſh the later kind of ſpeech is more agreeable to the nature of the toong; in greeke it is not ſo: but the ſenſe, euen in the Engliſh, is all one, though the words be not ſo well pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced. But let vs leaue theſe abſurdities, vpon which wee haue dwelt too long, a great deale longer then I purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and betake our ſelues to the matter.</p>
            <p>Yet perhaps it will not be amiſſe to adde a worde or two, firſt; for the remouing of a doubt, that may ariſe in ſome mans minde, who cannot ſatiſfy himſelfe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. And ſurely I am the bolder to ſpende the more time, and labour, in expounding the text, and making al things as plaine, as I can, becauſe I knowe, that one of <hi>Satans</hi> meanes, to diſcredit the doctrine, and make the exhortation out of any palce of Scripture, leſſe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21009:62"/> is to caſt ſome doubtes into mens heartes; about the true ſenſe of the text expounded. If hee can ſhew any likely hood of ſome other interpretation, then was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he makes accompt he hath aduantage enough, to perſwade vs not to regard what was taught vs, &amp; what we were exhorted to. For if the foundation bee weake, how ſhould the building be but ruinous? So likewiſe, if he cannot reaſonably obiect againſt the expounding of the place, yet if hee can raiſe ſome doubts, which were not ſatisfied, he will imploy men therein, and ſo drawe them away, from the meditation, and practiſe of that, which was deliuered. The doubt vpon this place, is in the later part of this clauſe, why the Euangeliſt ſhould add theſe words, <hi>without him was made:</hi> was it not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to haue ſaid, <hi>All things were made by him?</hi> yes ſurely, it was very ſufficient, both for the truth of the thing, and alſo for the vnderſtanding of it. What vſe is there then of this repetition? It helpes the memory, and as it were ſtirs vs vp to greater atttention. But the true reaſon of it, (as I conceiue) is, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt followeth the Hebrew phraſe very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; in which it is ordinary, to double that, by a negation, or deniall of the contrary, which before was affirmed.

            <p>Thus by the examining of the words, wee are come, at the laſt, to vnderſtand the Euangeliſts meaning: which is this; that <hi>all things whatſoeuer, which had any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of being (as all things had, except God onely) had that beginning, and being of theirs from the word, or Sonne of God.</hi> There is nothing ſo glorious in heauen aboue, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo meane on earth belowe, nothing ſo hidden, &amp; vnknowne in the depth of the Sea, but had his whole being from our Sauiour Chriſt.

            </p>
            <p>It may be, ſome man would knowe the reaſon, why our Euangeliſt, being to deſcribe our Sauiour, as the Creator of the world, doth not vſe the ſame kinde of ſpeech, which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth, and which alſo is common in the Scripture, to that purpoſe. Why doth hee not more particularly recite the things, that were created by him, and ſet out his glory therein at large as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth? I will tell you, in as few words, as I can. And firſt I ſay of both queſtions together, that therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did not ſpeake either ſo, or ſo largely, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done before, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſo done, and his purpoſe was not the ſame, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had in his writing.

Wee heard erewhile ſeuerall places to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; you may finde more at your leaſure. Wee preach vnto you (ſayth <note n="t" place="margin">Act 14. 25.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the men of <hi>Liſtra) That yee ſhould turne from theſe vaine things, to the liuing God, which made heauen and earth.</hi> So <note n="u" place="margin">Iſay. 37. 16.</note> ſayth <hi>Hezekiah, Thou art God alone ouer all the kingdomes of the earth, thou haſt made the heauen, and the earth.</hi> So <note n="x" place="margin">Ier. 32. 17.</note>

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:21009:63"/> yet ſaith our Euangeliſt; <hi>By him were all things made.</hi> Why ſo; As well becauſe by theſe words, all that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd might and would eaſily be conceiv'd, as alſo for that he would haue euen thoſe things to be vnderſtood whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> had made no expreſſe mention. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo doth <note n="y" place="margin">Col. 1. 16.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake otherwiſe of the creation, then <hi>Moſes,</hi> where hee ſayth of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, <hi>By him were all things created which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and which are in earth, things viſible and inuiſible, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers;</hi> then follow the very wordes of our Euangeliſt, <hi>All things were created by him.</hi> Thus hath Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taught vs how to expound Saint <hi>Iohn, All things viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and inuiſible.</hi> Of the later, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly; but rather by his particular deſcription of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts of the world, ſeemes to tell vs, that hee ſpake of them onely. So might our Euangeliſt alſo haue been vnderſtood, if hee had ſo ſpoken; whereas now wee are to expound him of both, according as the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects vs. But why doth not Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> (as the leaſt) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Moſes</hi> courſe, and deſcribe the particulars at large? Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt, that euer writ that hiſtorie of creation, and writ it of purpoſe, to giue knowledge of it to all poſteritie: But our Euangeliſt neither needed doe that, which which was perform'd ſo excellently, ſo long before, by another; and intended, not to ſet out the hiſtorie, but rather to apply it to the preſent occaſion. Hee had alſo a more worthy matter to handle, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hee haſted, the redemption of the children of God, by the promiſed <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Giue mee leaue I pray you a little to conſider the glorie of our heauenly redeemer, and to inſult ouer all ſuch miſcreants, Iewes, and Turkes, as deſpiſe his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offer of ſaluation, and refuſe him, as not worth the truſting in.

I deny not, that hee was ready enough before, to haue done the like; but our Sauiour ſpeakes of that

This (in part) our Sauiour himſelfe, in that place, ſignifieth; when hee addes, immediatly vpon the former words, that <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And yet that is the ordinary meate of ſuch thinges, as craul vppon the land. As for thoſe, that creepe in the water, mudde and ſlyme is their ordinary ſuſtenance.

               <hi>Peter,</hi> by a voice from heauen.

Then there came a voice to him, willing him to kill and eate. Is not this a ſufficient proofe of their creation and cleanneſs?

But <hi>Peter</hi> remembring that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to bee eaten, as vncleane, began to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

            <p>Well, ſay you: let them be cleane forvſe, eſpecially in acaſe of neceſſity; yet they are not worthy to be held for the creatures of God. Not worthy, and yet haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mouing, and life? Any one of theſe were ſufficient to make them ſhew ſome part of his greatneſſe, from whom they are. Take the leaſt of the 3.

               <hi>This is the ſinger of God.</hi> Surely, if making lice of duſt, be not diſhonourable to God, but the wretched ſorcerers are inforced to acknowledge his power in them, what madnes is it, to deny him the creation of the ſmalleſt, and meaneſt things? Yet I would not be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if I thought, that euery kinde of ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, was made at the firſt creation, within the compaſs of thoſe ſix daies. It is enough for vs to beleeue, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that all things had their being from God; both for their nature, and their properties, and that no kind of creature hath bin, is, or ſhal be, at any time, bred, but according to the appointment of the Lord, and by the meanes, which he from the beginning ordained, &amp; fitted to that purpoſe. Thence it is, that diuerſe liuing creatures are daily bred of duſt, mudd, ſlyme, and ſuch like: Not as if theſe things fell out thus, by chaunce, or aroſe from the nature of theſe matters, without the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, &amp; foreappointment of God the creatour of them. Nay rather, therefore did he ſo temper, and order theſe things, becauſe he had decreed to haue ſuch creatures bred of them from time to time.</p>
            <p>Let vs come yet neerer to theſe dainty ones, and (if it be poſſible) giue them a full and perfect view of their error. Me thinkes their dealing with God in this matter, is much like to that of <hi>Ahaz</hi> in another caſe. Whome when the Prophet willed to aske a ſigne for his aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Lord, his tender heart would not bee ſo bold with God; <note n="t" place="margin">Iſay. 7. 11. 12.</note>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21009:71"/> like ſort theſe men, that are ſo iealous of Gods glory, will not graunte that hee ſhould bee the maker of ſuch meane things: But in the meane while, they are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, either to deny him to be the fountaine of al being and ſo to make him no God, or elſe to aſcribe theſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures to ſome chaunce or neceſſity, not before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by him; and ſo put him then as it were to his ſhiftes, to make the beſt of that, which he cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe helpe. But if theſe curious men would imploy that time and ſtudy, in ſearching the nature, &amp; parts of theſe little deſpiſed creatures, which they beſtow in deuiſing idle, and fooliſh arguments, to bewray their bold ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, they ſhould find more cauſe to wonder at the wiſedome of God, in their ſmalneſſe, then to deny him to be the maker of them, becauſe of any imagined baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Is there not beauty in a cleare diamond, though it be but a ſparke?

But what are all theſe, and as many ſuch like deuiſes, and pecces of workmanſhip as can be imagined, if you compare them, with theſe little creatures? Didſt thou neuer ſee a worme, or fly ſo little, that thou couldſt hardly diſcerne it with thy neeye, though thou lookedſt earneſtly vpon it, which yet mou'd, and crept, turn'd and return'd this way and that way, with no ſlowe paſe?

               <hi>He maketh his Sunne to ariſe on the euill indeed, and ſendeth his raigne on the vniuſt.</hi> And not on the good, and iuſt? Hee prouideth for both, but with a diuerſe affection.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death for their miſdeedes? Why ſo? Becauſe they meane to make their loue of Iuſtice knowne to al men, and to powre on ſuch malefactors the ſhame, they haue deſerued. The Romane Generals had an eſpeciall care, in all their conqueſts, to haue the principal of their enimies aliue, that they might afterwards leade them in triumph to ſhew their glory. So doth the Lorde deale with the great, and mighty wicked ones of the world: He feedes them with the beſt and daintieſt meate, hee cloaths them with the coſtlieſt, and gayeſt apparell, hee ſets them out as it were to ſhewe, that all men may take notice of them; to the ende, that at the laſt, hee may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer them the more gloriouſly.

Hee can make ſupply to thee of all things, when hee will, and hee will when hee fees it beſt for thee. But it is his power, of which we now ſpeake.

            <p>There remaines yet one doubt: which I reſeru'd, of purpoſe, for this place, though I had occaſion to haue ſpoken of it before, in the interpretation of the later part of the Text. Some by <hi>Nothing,</hi> vnderſtand <hi>Sinne;</hi> as if the Euangeliſt had meant to ſignifie that <hi>Sinne</hi> was made, without him that was the Creator of all things: but how then could this ſpeech be true? If ſomething were made without him, how were all things made by him? Surely if we take that diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the verſes for good, and that ſenſe for true, which they, that by <hi>Nothing</hi> will haue <hi>Sinne</hi> to be meant, approue and follow; wee may well be ſuſpected, to make God the author of ſinne. <hi>That which was made</hi> (ſay thoſe men) <hi>In him was life:</hi> who would not conceiue this to bee ſpoken of that, which went next before? Let vs make this a little plainer: Thus
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21009:73"/> they reade the text; <hi>without him was made nothing. That, which was made, in him was life.</hi> Is it not more reaſonable to referre theſe laſt words, <hi>That which was made,</hi> to that <hi>nothing,</hi> which they ſay was made, then to <hi>All things,</hi> in the former part of the verſe, as I noted before? If it had been the holy Ghoſtes purpoſe to ſeuer theſe middle words, in ſenſe, where hee ſpeakes of <hi>Nothing,</hi> from the former, &amp; in the fourth verſe to ſpeake againe of thoſe <hi>All things,</hi> he would not haue ſaid, <hi>That, which was made; but thoſe things that were made.</hi> If then we take this <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> for ſomething, which was made, without the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and by <hi>Nothing</hi> vnderſtand ſinne, wee affirme in the next words, that ſinne was life in him. By <hi>Nothing</hi> therefore, <hi>Sinne</hi> is not meant: but the word muſt be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it properly ſignifieth, and this later part bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a deniall of the contrary to that, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the former clauſe.</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe the queſtion, concerning the being of ſinne, ariſeth from the doctrine, which the Euangeliſt here propoundeth: It is requiſit to ſay ſomewhat of it. <hi>All things were made by him;</hi> If all things then ſinne too, vnleſſe that be ſimply nothing, or be, of it ſelfe, eternall and infinit, as nothing is, but God only. Neither will it ſerue the turne to ſay, that <hi>All things, that were made, were made by him.</hi> For by theſe words, <hi>that were made,</hi> nothing is exempted from being made, but he only, that made al all things, God almightie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. It ſeemes then, that ſinne was made; &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker it could haue none, but him that made all things, that were made, that is all things, beſides himſelfe. Ther fore ſinne alſo was made by him. O blaſphemy! God the author of ſinne? How ſhall hee then condemne the world for ſinne? For what is there, or can there bee from him, that is nothing, but goodneſſe, which is not good? And ſhall men be iudged for that, which is good? Here, what the <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 5. 29.</note> Iudge himſelfe ſaith; <hi>They ſhall come forth that</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:21009:73"/> 
               <hi>haue done good, to the reſurrection of life, and they that haue done euill, to the reſurrection of condemnation. Be it far from the Lord</hi> (ſaith <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 18 25.</note> faithfull <hi>Abraham) to ſtay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous ſhould bee euen as the wicked; be it far from him. And ſhall not the Iudge of all the world doe right?</hi> Therefore this muſt bee laid, as a maine foundation in diuinity, that ſinne, whatſoeuer it bee, is no creature of Gods making. What if I through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, be not able to make the point cleare? Shall it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be doubted of? I haue ſaid enough already to proue the truth of the matter, that <hi>Sinne is no creature of God;</hi> I am now only to deſcribe the nature of it to you, that you may be the better ſatiſfied.

            <p>But whether we offend by too much, or too little, ſtill the ſinne is ſome act, or action, and is comprized in that vſuall diſtribution, thought, word, and deed. Thought is an action of the inward parts only, the braine, &amp; the heart, or the vnderſtanding, and the will. Word addeth to the former a ſecond part, performed by the toong. Deed imployeth the whole body, or ſome members, or member of it, to the doing of ſome outward euill. Al are actions, or deeds, to ſpeake truly: but theſe later haue appropriated that name to themſelues, becauſe they haue an effect, that is moſt ſenſible, and knowne by feeling. I will keepe my ſelfe to the point in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and though many things offer themſelues to bee ſpoken of; yet I will reſt content with that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to my preſent purpoſe, reſeruing all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to their ſeueral places, and iuſt occaſions. Sin then (as we haue hitherto ſpoken of it) is nothing elſe, but an aberration, or ſtraying from the law of God, by doing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21009:74"/> that, we ſhould not do, or not doing that, we ſhould do, Can there now bee any reaſonable cauſe of doubting, whether ſinne were created by God, or no?

Whether we conſider the inward thoughts of the heart, or the outward actions of the body, what finde we, that we may call a creature?

But this only by the way, leaſt ſome ſcruple ſhould ariſe in ſome man: mind, touching Gods actions in the ſinnes of men.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21009:75"/> concerning the inward wickedneſſe, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature. For although I am perſwaded, that the law of the 10 Commandements, is only the rule of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, teaching what we ſhould, or ſhould not doe, and not the patterne of our nature, ſhewing what wee ought to be: yet I am out of doubt, that this proneneſs to ſin, and vntowardnes to al good, which euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> findeth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is iuſtly diſpleaſing to God, becauſe his image ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is defaced; &amp; iuſtly charged vpon vs as ſinne, becauſe by our fault, it hath ſeized on vs. Therefore taking this (for the preſent) as graunted; let vs examin the matter, &amp; ſee whether there bee any thing, in this naughtineſſe of our nature, which may be truly ſaid to be the creature of God. Firſt, it is out of all queſtion, that the ſoule it ſelfe, in which this corruption reſteth, is the workmanſhip of God; I breathed as it were by him into the body perfitly <note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> formed, in the creation of man. Whether it bee immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly created by him ſtill, as I doe verily perſwade my ſelf, or come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the parents, as the matter of the body doth, it is not much to our purpoſe, for the point wee haue in hand. It is enough for the thing, we handle, that wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to be the maker of it. Secondly, it is not to be doubted, but that, as the ſubſtance of the ſoule, ſo the qualities thereof alſo, proceed from the ſame God, as from their maker. For hee that <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> made man after his own image, and likeneſſe, made thoſe faculties of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and will, and thoſe qualities of holyneſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <note n="n" place="margin">Eph. 4. 24.</note> wherein that image only, or eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. Is it not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be feared, leaſt we ſhould make God the author of this naughtineſſe, by which we are prone to euill, ſince it is a quality abiding in the ſoule? Some haue thought to ſhift off the matter, by denying, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature is any thing elſe, but an abſence of goodneſſe, for want of which, wee can neither doe, nor deſire ought, that is good. But this doth too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the badneſſe of our hearts, which are proclaimed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21009:75"/> where in Scripture, not only not to incline to that, which is good, but to affect, and like of that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; yea to be wholly bent to euill, and to nothing elſe. <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord ſaw, that all the imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart were only euill continually.</hi> Therefore <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle pronounceth of all men, that while they are in their naturall eſtate, not freed by grace, they <hi>are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of ſinne.</hi> And all ſuch <note n="q" place="margin">I. Ioh. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>S. Iohn</hi> calleth the <hi>children of the Deuill:</hi> and doubteth not to affirme, that the <hi>whole worldlyeth in wickedneſſe.</hi> But what needes any more, or <note place="margin">&amp; 5. 19.</note> better proofe, then that diſcourſe, which the Apoſtle maketh, where he ſets out the greeuous miſery of our corrupt nature, vpon experience, that he himſelfe had, &amp; that all men haue of their vntowardneſſe to do good, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after they haue receiued the ſpirit of regeneration, <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 7. 14. 15. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>I ſee a law in my members, rebelling againſt the law of my minde, and leading me captiue vnto the law of ſinne, which is in my members.</hi> I leaue it to euery mans conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to iudge what wee are before grace, if we bee ſuch after it.</p>
            <p>If then this our naturall corruption, be more then a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or abſence of that righteouſneſſe, which was, and ought to be in vs, what is it, but an euill quality? If a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it muſt needes haue had a beginning, either with the ſoule, or after it. If ſo, from whom can it be imagined to haue had that being, but from him, that is the autor of all being? Wherevpon it ſeemes neceſſary to follow, that ſinne is to be reckned in the number of thoſe <hi>All things,</hi> that were made by Ieſus Chriſt. But this was diſclaimed before, as blaſphemous. What ſhall we ſay then? Shall we deny that euery quality is made by God? How can wee poſſibly doe ſo, with any reaſon? For euery quality hath a being: and euery being is good. Neither is there any good, but from God, as the autor thereof: Elſe were not he the only true good; if there were any thing good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him, which is not good by him. What remaines, but
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21009:76"/> to affirme, that this <hi>Corruption, or naughtineſſe, is no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</hi> How may that appeare? I will endeauour to make it plaine by a likeneſſe, or ſimilitude. What thinke you of the diſtempers, that happen often times in the body? When it ſhakes, and quiuers, with the cold of an ague? when it burnes like fire, with the extreame heate of a feuer? When it flowes with moyſture in a dropſie? Are theſe alterations, new qualities created by God? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rottenneſſe in an apple; or a conſumption in the body, I ſpeake of or in any member of it. Can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how theſe things may bee, without the creation of any new quality? Imagin the like of that corruption, which poſſeſſeth the ſoule of man. Certainely, putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and rottenneſſe, are not qualities made by the Creatour; but rather corruptions of the naturall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where with hee inriched, and beautified his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>What then? Are they nothing, but the priuation, or abſence of that, which was giuen by nature? Yes ſure. Take example of the apple before named. The colour, and taſt of it may be gone, and all vertue to nouriſh; and yet the fruit not be rotten: The body of a man, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature, may haue loſt power to moue, yea life it ſelfe too, and yet not forth with bee putrified, or ſauour. <hi>He ſtinkes before this time</hi> (quoth <hi>Martha</hi> of her brother <hi>Lazarus) for he hath beene dead foure daies.</hi> The qualities of the ſoule, being things, that belong to the nature of it, according to the creation, alwaies continue with the ſoule; but they may be diſtempred, and diſord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new worke of god by creating other, inſtead of them. Marke I pray you a little, when a man by ſtudy attaines to the knowledge of any art, doth the Creator make ſuch a new quality? Doth he not rather bleſſe him to the perfiting of that, which was as the firſt created in him? If this knowledge decay by any diſeaſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or by any careleſneſſe of the minde, is the former
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21009:76"/> quality perhaps lately made, as it were vnmade againe? Or may we happely haue the like made, and mard from day to day? I might ſay the like of morall vertues. The reaſon is all one. You will ſay perchaunce; that you ſee not, how there can be any ſuch corruption, in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the ſoule, as you diſcerne plainely to happen in the body. Surely, I confeſſe mine ignorance in the ſame point with you. Neither do I any way go about to ſhew how it is, but me thinks I ſee by good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it is ſo. If we had as much knowledge of the nature of the ſoule and the qualities thereof, as we haue of the body, and the humours therein, I doubt not, but we ſhould as plainely diſcerne the one, as we ſee the other.</p>
            <p>Let all this be graunted, may ſome man ſay; that this naughtineſſe of nature inſues, vpon the committing of the firſt ſinne, as a corruption of the created qualities, which the ſoule was indued withall, at her making: I would faine knowe, why this may not challenge God for the autor of it, as well as thoſe creatures, which you confeſſe before, to take their beginning from the ſlyme, and mudde of the earth, and water mingled together. They come of the corruption of thoſe principles of all bodyly things, at the leaſt all vnder the moone; as theſe are ſaid to be from the decay of thoſe qualities: For the better ſatiſfying of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, touching this doubt, I would entreat them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider theſe manifeſt differences: Firſt, that the Lord directly, and principally, intending the bringing forth of thoſe creatures, as tending to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the world, accordingly fitted the nature of the earth, and water, that, by the power of the Sunn, ſuch thing: might be formed of them.</p>
            <p>But the wickedneſſe of our nature, being not in ſuch ſort appointed by God, but only vpon a ſuppoſition of the fall of man, by ſinne; this corruption proceedes not from neceſſity of nature, but from the iuſt curſe of God vpon all vs. that ſinned. Secondly, it is farder to be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21009:77"/> obſerued, that thoſe creatures ſo bred, become ſeuerall &amp; diſtinct things from that, where of they are bred; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a being in themſelues, and no way depending on the ſlyme, or mudde. So is not this corruption, we ſpeak of; which hath no being, in it ſelf, diſtinct from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; but ſo cleaues to it, that without it, it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But a wen, or bunch growing out of the tree, thogh it receiue nouriſhment from it, and grow with it, is no new creature, nor ſubſtance by it ſelfe. So is it with thoſe things that breede of ſlime, as with the griſts; ſo with the naughtineſſe of our nature, as with vnnaturall ſwellings in trees, or liuing creatures. Thirdly (which I deſire to haue markt) the Lord hath an eſpeciall hand, in giuing life to thoſe forenamed creatures, and in framing their members, that they may be apt for motion. The Sunne, &amp; ſlime, as it were afford, &amp; temper the matter, wherof they are to be made: but the Former of it is God himſelf. May we auouch the like of that corruption, where with our nature is defiled? I trow not. God in Iuſtice will haue it to be, he doth not by creation giue it being. And thus much of the creation of all things, mentioned by our Euangeliſt; Now let vs conſider, why hee doth here mention it, and what he intends to proue by it.</p>

            <p>The queſtion is, whether the creation of al things, be a ſufficient proofe of his diuine nature, that created them, or no.

            <p>For the place in hand, it is commonly thought to be meant of that natural life, which all liuing creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from their creator; as if the Euangeliſt ſhould haue ſayd, that not onely all things were made by him, as the author of their being, but alſo that they had their
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21009:81"/> life too from him. But this (ſauing their better iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that ſo expound the text) ſeemes to me ſomewhat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. For why ſhould the Euangeliſt repeate that in this verſe, which hee had deliuered ſo fully immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before? <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> Was there any feare, that ſome exception would bee taken to theſe wordes? could any man imagine, that <hi>this making of all things,</hi> implyed no more, but the outwarde faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and framing of them, and not alſo the inwarde forme, and wholenature? If wee will giue the wordes leaue to reach as farre, as by their nature, they doe, <hi>All things</hi> muſt needes import the ſame thinges in their beſt eſtate, with all their naturall qualities, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and whatſoeuer elſe belongs to their being that, which they are. For example, let vs ſpeake a word or two of ſome particulars. <hi>By him were all trees made.</hi> What would a reaſonable man vnderſtand by this ſpeech? That the body of the trees onely, or the roots, boughes, and branches, and leaues, and not the life of the Trees was made by him? Surely, to ſpeake according to truth, all theſe, without the life, and forme, doe no more make a Tree, then a body without a ſoule doth a Man. I might ſay the like of men. <hi>By him were all men made.</hi> If the Lord God had onely framed <hi>Adam</hi> of the duſt of the ground, and not breathed into his face, the breath of life; might hee haue beene ſayd, to haue created a man? No ſurely: vnleſſe a carcaſe bee a man, after the ſoule is departed out of it. But, let vs thinke the Euangeliſt might haue ſuch a meaning, would he (trow yee) haue ſpoken, as hee doth, if he had meant as you ſay? <hi>In him was life,</hi> that is, (ſay you) <hi>Hee alſo gaue life to all things that hee had made.</hi> Who can ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue himſelfe, as to conceiue, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would deliuer his minde ſo darkely, and doubtfully? Beſide, was not this, you ſpeake of, a creature? If ſo, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compris'd vnder thoſe generall tearmes, <hi>All things,</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:21009:82"/> and needed no repetition. Neither will this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word agree fitly with that, which followeth. Is it not euident, that <hi>the life, and the light,</hi> are of the ſame kinde, both naturall, or both ſupernaturall? But, <hi>the light,</hi> as it ſhall appeare anone, is that of grace to faith, not of nature to knowledge. For the light of nature did comprehend the Creator ſo far, as to acknowledge it ſelfe to proceede from him, and to depend vpon him. Therefore <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> doth not accuſe the heathen of ignorance, for not knowing God, to be their maker; but for not honouring him, according to the knowledge, they had of him. <hi>The inuiſible things of God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that is, his eternall power, and Godhead, are ſeen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by the creation of the world, being conſidered in his workes, that they might bee without excuſe. Becauſe when they knew</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> 
               <hi>God, they glorified him not as God.</hi> So then, the Heathen for all the darkeneſſe of nature, did comprehend the <hi>life,</hi> that was the naturall light of their ſoules. If you anſwere, that they did not perfitly vnderſtand all things that concerne him as the Creator: you ſay true, but not much to purpoſe. For, who is there, that euer did o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> can, eſpecially while hee liues in this world, compaſſed about with this houſe of clay, ſo fully conceiue thoſe points, as they are to bee, and ſhall be, after this life, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood?</p>
            <p>But ſome man will ſay, perhaps, that although the giuing of life to all things, was ſignified in the making of them: yet the preſeruing, and maintaining of it, was not. Nor of their being; which can no more bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, without the power of God ſupport them in it, then their life can. Therefore the Apoſtle, deſcribing our Sauiour Chriſts Godhead, ſets it out by this verie worke thereof; when he ſayth of him, that <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>He beares vp all things, by his mightie word:</hi> and <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> in another place, where hee tels the heathen, that <hi>they liu'd and mou'd in God,</hi> hee adde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo, that <hi>in him they had their being.</hi> If
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21009:82"/> then there were no neceſſitie to expreſſe the ſuſtaining of all things in their being, no more was there to note particularly the continuing of them in life. Yea, perhaps it might be dangerous to mention the later, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the former; leaſt ſome men ſhould gather, that all thinges ſtand in neede of God to preſerue their life, but not to continue their being. Giue mee leaue to apply one of my former exceptions, to the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this matter alſo. How ſtrangely doth the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt ſpeake, if his meaning be, as you make it? <hi>In him was life.</hi> That is, Hee preſerues all thinges in life. Could this point bee more obſcurely deliuered? What reaſon can you giue mee, why the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay <hi>was,</hi> when he intended to ſignifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall preſeruing of life? why did hee not rather ſay, <hi>In him is life;</hi> Or in him the life of all thinges is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preſerv'd? But if by life, you will haue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of things in their being ſignified, I deſire to ſee ſome warrant of Scripture, or ground of reaſon, for the vſing of that word, in that ſenſe. Surely there can bee no ſuch found in any place of all the Scripture, either or the word <hi>life,</hi> or for the phraſe, <hi>In him was life.</hi>

               <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> Where had our firſt parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> their ſpirituall <hi>life,</hi> after the Curſe, but in him? In whom was the couenant eſtabliſhed with <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 12. 3. Gal. 3. 8.</note>

               <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt yeſter-day, and to day, and the ſame for euer.</hi> They beleeued in Chriſt to come: wee beleeue in him being come. They ſaw him not; but were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, hee ſhould bee ſeene, at the time appointed. Neither haue wee ſeene him; but are out of doubt, that hee was ſeene, while he liued here vpon the earth. They truſted in him, as the onely and all-ſufficient meanes of life. Is not our faith the ſame? Therefore leaſt any man ſhould imagine that the Fathers, which died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour Chriſt was born, were deſtitute of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, our Euangeliſt aſſures vs, that there was, euen then, life in him.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons may giue ſome good ſatisfaction to them, who deſire rather to informe themſelues, to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then to aime themſelues, for contention. Giue me leaue alſo, I pray you, to propound to your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp; meditation, at your better leaſure, what it hath pleaſed God I ſhould conceiue of this matter: would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man knowe of me, why the Euangeliſt ſaith <hi>In him was,</hi> rather then <hi>In him is life?</hi> I think, he may be fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, if he do aduiſedly conſider, that hee continueth the courſe, which he begun, in the firſt verſe, &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond, and third. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. The ſame was. By him were: without him was.</hi> Do not meruaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Euangeliſt ſayth here, <hi>In him was life.</hi> Tell mee how hee could haue ſpoken more fitly? Hee proceedes in the deſcription of the Meſſiah, touching his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip; whoſe Godhead he had before declared. Could he doe better, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold on the ſame manner of ſpeech? But, will you ſee yet a farther reaſon? that nothing may be wanting, which may helpe vou forward in the vnderſtanding of this ſcripture. Who knowes not, that the Euangeliſt, (according to the ordinary courſe which they take that write the hyſtories of famous
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21009:85"/> men) ſettes downe in the beginning a briefe deſcription of him, of whom afterward hee is to intreat at large: by ſhewing that in particular, which was, at the firſt, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in a generall ſort? This being ſo, let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the hiſtorie is of him, that is not now liuing amongſt vs, but departed out of this life from vs. Therefore it was neceſſarie for our Euangeliſt to ſpeak of him, as of one that had beene, and now was not. Not as if hee were not now at all: but becauſe hee is not now aliue, in the world, as hee was, when thoſe things were done, the hiſtorie whereof is written in this Goſpell. So then, we muſt conceiue, that Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> in ſaying <hi>was,</hi> hath reſpect to the time of our Sauiours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein our nature; and therefore not only might, but ought alſo to ſay, <hi>In him was,</hi> rather then <hi>In him is life:</hi> becauſe he is totel vs, what he did, here in the world and not what hee doth, now he is out of the world. This the holy Ghoſt teacheth vs, when he ſaith <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 30.</note> toward and <note n="l" place="margin">Ioh 21. 25.</note> in the end of this Goſpell; <hi>Many other ſignes alſo did Ieſus, and there are alſo many other things which Ieſus did.</hi> Yet the ende of all is, <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31.</note> 
               <hi>that wee might beleeue that Ieſus is the Chriſt; and ſo, that life is in him, now for vs, as well as it was for them, that liued in his time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The excellent comfort of this doctrine drawes mee to it with both the hands, but that my promiſe holdes mee backe very ſtrongly. Let me firſt diſcharge this, &amp; then I will beſtowe my ſelfe wholly vpon the handling of that more at large. I vndertooke to ſhewe theſe two thinges; what ſpirituall life is here ſignified: of grace, or of glorie, or of both; why the tearme life is applyed to note that holineſſe, and happineſſe. I doubt not, but euerie man perceiues already, that by life, I vnderſtand as well our liuing righteouſly in this world, as our liuing gloriouſly in the world to come. How elſe could it note ſuch holineſſe, and happineſſe? The reaſon (perhaps) is not ſo apparant. I will doo
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21009:85"/> my beſt endeuour, to giue you ſatisfaction, touching that alſo. It is verie fitte, if not neceſſarie, to giue as large an extent to all texts of Scripture, as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the preſent place, and the ordinarie vſe of the wordes will beare; leaſt wee ſeeme to reſtraine the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, more then wee are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by him to doe. And therefore I could haue beene contented to haue ſtretched the worde, euen to note the preſeruing of naturall life; but that I can finde no ſuch vſe of it in the Scripture: neither will that ſenſe well agree, with that expoſition, which the light in the ſecond clauſe ſeemes neceſſarily to require; as I hope to make it appeare anone, if God will.</p>
            <p>But neither any circumſtance of the place tieth <hi>life</hi> to the one, or to the other: and the word is diuers times taken in both ſenſes. <hi>Of eternall life,</hi> what ſhall I need to bring many examples? This Goſpell is full of them. I will giue you a taſte, by one, or two. <hi>Yee ſearch the Scriptures</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 39. 40.</note> (ſayth our Sauiour to the Iewes) <hi>for in them yee thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they, which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of mee. Yet yee will not come to mee, that yee might haue life.</hi> That, which in the former verſe, hee nameth <hi>eternall life,</hi> in the later hee calleth ſimply <hi>life.</hi> The <note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> like wee haue in the ſame Chapter, not very many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before; <hi>Hee, that beleeueth in him, that ſent mee, hath euerlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but hath paſſed from death to life.</hi> To what <hi>life?</hi> Euen to euerlaſting <hi>life,</hi> which he was ſayd before to haue. The other <hi>life,</hi> grace in this world, both is implyed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the <hi>life</hi> of glorie, whereof alſo it is a part, the Image of God in vs being renewed by it, and is manie times ſpoken of by it ſelfe, as I ſhewed at large be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, out of <note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 4. 24.</note> diuerſe places of Scripture. It is needleſſe to repeate them, or to adde more to them. What ſhould hinder vs then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expounding this life ſo largely, as wee haue done? Nave, might wee not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21009:86"/> be thought iniurious, to the holy Ghoſt, if wee ſhould leaue out either of them? By <hi>life</hi> then, wee vnderſtand that ſpirituall eſtate of righteouſneſſe, and glory, of which all, that beleeue in Chriſt, are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, by beeing ingraffed into his myſticall bodie. Would any man knowe, why this eſtate, into which wee are reſtored by our Sauiour, ſhould be tearmed <hi>life?</hi> I aunſwere him, in a word, becauſe the miſerable eſtate, into which wee fell by ſinne, was called by the name of death. It will not bee vnworthy our labour, to conſider this point a little. When the Lord God had made our firſt parents, and placed them in that palace of pleaſure, the garden of Paradiſe, <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 2. 8.</note> Hee charged them to forbeare to eate of the Tree of <hi>the knowledge of good and euill;</hi> threatning them, that if they brake his commaundement, that <hi>day,</hi> that they ate thereof, <note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> they ſhould <hi>dye</hi> the death.

So ſaith <note n="r" place="margin">Luk. 15. 32.</note> the kind Father of the prodigal Sonne: <hi>This thy brother was dead.</hi> Dead? The parable had ſaid no ſuch thing of him. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was that death, the Father ſpeaks of?

Firſt <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 5.</note> our Sauiour ſaith <hi>we muſt be borne againe:</hi> what needs that if we were neuer dead? And <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 6. 2.</note> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>S.

The life of the one is alwaies the dea'h of the other. If thou liue to ſinne, thou art dead to righteouſnes. If thou liue to righteouſnes, thou art dead to ſinne. Therefore <note n="x" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>S. Peter</hi> ioynes them both together, <hi>That we being dead to ſinne, might liue to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath the like ſpeech, in vnlike tearmes. <hi>When</hi> (<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 6. 20.</note> ſaith he) <hi>yee were the ſeruants of ſinne, yee were freed from righteouſneſſe.

               <hi>made ſeruants vnto God.</hi> Marke I pray you, how one of theſe, as it were, deſtroies the other. A naturall man without grace is free from righteouſneſſe, yea as free, as a dead man is, from all matters of this worlde. A ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall man indued with grace is free from ſinne; yea as free as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was from all the cares of this worlde, while he lay in his graue, without life or breath. But I may not forget my ſelfe too much. The ſumme of all is this, that our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, our Euangeliſt, deſcribeth the eſtate, into which we are brought, by becomming members of his body,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21009:87"/> by the tearm of life, becauſe ourformer eſtate, out of which he deliuered vs, was in name, &amp; nature, an eſtate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> death.</p>
            <p>Now hauing examined the words, let vs come to the doctrine it ſelfe. <hi>In him was life:</hi> which is all one, as if the holy Euangeliſt ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>This word, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah, of whom I haue begun to intreat, and intend to write this ſtory, not only was eternall, hauing his being, before any thing created ever began to be; &amp; that with God, euen then, when there was nothing beſide God: but was alſo himſelfe very God. From him al things, that are, or euer were, had their whole being: in him, the ſpirituall life, both of grace, and glory was ſo pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that who ſoeuer deſires to be partaker of it, muſt haue it only, as in him, being come into the world.</hi> This is that which we are to learne out of this place. In the handling whereof, I will firſt deliuer the doctrine, that our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life is by Chriſt; then I will ſpeake of the manner, how it is by him. Concerning the former point, firſt I wil propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it in general: then I wil ſhew it in thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of holynes, &amp; happynes, The manner alſo hath 2. things to bee conſidered. That this life was in Chriſt, &amp; that it was in him, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> while he liued here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt point, that our eſtate is to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by our Sauiour, Chriſt, let me put you in mind of thoſe places which I once before alleag'd, &amp; which are indeed the very foundation of the Goſpell. By ſinne the diuell got dominion ouer vs, God in iuſtice leauing vs, when we had forſaken him, &amp; Satan iniuſtly ſeizing on vs, as it were intruding himſelfe into a houſe void of any owner, to keepe poſſeſſion. But the Lord God, though he would not preſently thruſt out by the head, &amp; ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or pluck out by the eares that preſumptuous intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: yet tels him, that he ſhould not imagin, he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or ſhould hold quiet poſſeſſion for euer. <hi>I will put enmity</hi>

This ſhews ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, that the deuill ſhall loſe his poſſeſſion; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may reenter: or if he do not, yet are wee by this meanes rather freed from miſery, then reſtored to feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Let vs go forward therfore, and heare the promiſe that God makes to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull: <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 12. 3.</note>

               <hi>S.

            <p>See, I pray you, &amp; conſider a little with me, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; greate reaſons we haue, to bee inflamed with the loue of Ieſus Chriſt.

Thou ſhalt not need to climbe vp to heauen. <note n="h" place="margin">lib. 3. 13</note> Ieſus Chriſt of his owne accord, without thy deſire, or thought of any ſuch matter, came downe from thence, &amp; brought life with him.

Tell me not, how long thou haſt bin dead. The ſtrength of death growes not by continuance, as ſickneſſe doth.

               <hi>He,</hi> that hath bin dead, but one hower, is as void of life, as he that died a yeere ago.

            <p>If the force of life be ſo greate, that no contrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is of ſtrength to make head againſt it, may it not well ſeem exceeding ſtrange, that ſo few recouer life, or once looke after it. <note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 39. 40.</note> Our Sauiour complaines of the Iewes, that although they ſearch the Scripturs, with an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that euerlaſting life was to be had out of them, &amp; thoſe Scriptures teſtified of him, that he was the autor of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e we vnwilling to haue life? That is not poſſible, ſeing our chiefeſt care is to maintaine life. Doe wee deſpaire of means to come by it? The leaſt ſhew of hope will make a man try any courſe, that ſhall be directed him. It is a rare thing, to find any man ſo void of hope to liue, that he will not take whatſoeuer is offered him, to continue life. Is the remedy more greeuous, then the diſeaſe? what is eaſier in the opinion of ordinary men, then to belieue? Shall I tell you, what I conceiue of the matter? There are 2 lets, that ſtay vs commonly from the ſeeking, and embracing of this life. Either we are too wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceited of our ſelues, or not well enough perſwaded of him, in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21009:89"/> whom this life is. Would you haue me ſeeke for life? Let them looke after it that lack it. I haue life already in my ſelfe, and need not depend vpon any other for it. <hi>I am rich, and increaſed with goods, and haue neede of nothing,</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Reu. 3. 17.</note> ſaith the Church of Laodicea: and yet indeed as our Sauiour there tells her, <hi>She was wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked.</hi> This conceipt naturally poſſeſſeth all men; and where this is rooted, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, there is neither roome for ſpiritual life to grow, nor will to plant it. But this, becauſe it is ſo agreeable to the pride of our corrupt nature, is the leſſe to bee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at. The other hinderance, whereby wee are helde backe from this life, is more ſtrange, and leſſe excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. There are many, that make open profeſſion to all the world, that they knowe themſelues to be naturally dead, and to ſtand in neede of life to quicken them; yea they goe farder; and, in wordes, acknowledge, that the life, they want, is in Chriſt: and yet (like thoſe Iewes, I ſpake of ere-while) they care not to ioyne themſelues to Chriſt, that they may be made partakers thereof.</p>
            <p>This I take to be generally the eſtate of moſt of vs, that are called Chriſtians. Do we not all profeſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in Ieſus Chriſt? Do we not thereby acknowledge, that we are dead in our ſelues, and looke to receiue life from him? And yet, how few of vs are there, that indeed are ſo perſwaded? Thinke not much, that I make this greeuous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint. If we did truely beleue that in heart which we confeſſe from the teeth outward, were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible we ſhould be ſo careleſſe? where can you find me one amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt a greate many, that either knowes or cares to knowe how this life is to be come by?

Let thine owne ſoule tell thee in ſecret, betwixt it, and thee, whether thy affection to this autor of life bee ſuch, as the feeling of ſo greate a bleſſing can not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly chuſe but make it.

            <p>But I dwel too long in the general. Let vs come now to the particulars; and firſt to the life of holynes; which is ſo abſolutely from Chriſt, that the Apoſtle ſaith it is not himſelfe, that liueth, but Chriſt, that liueth in him. Will you heare him ſpeake. <hi>I through the lawe</hi> (<note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 2. 19. 20.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Paul) am dead to the law; and that I might liue</hi>

               <hi>vnto God, I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> Thus I liue; <hi>yet not I now, but Chriſt liueth in me.</hi> For the ſpirit, by which wee liue, is <note n="r" place="margin">Eph. 4. 15. 16.</note> the ſpirit of Chriſt reſting in him, as in the head, and ſpreading himſelfe abroad into euery one of the members, to giue them their proportion of life, and growth. This is that, which (<note n="ſ" place="margin">

               </note> in another place) is call'd <hi>the ſpirit of life, which is in Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> and which is there ſaid <hi>to haue freed vs from the law of ſinne.</hi> The Iewes bragd they were free by nature, becauſe they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children. <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 33. 34.</note> But our Sauiour aunſweres them, that they were the ſeruants of ſinne, becauſe they committed ſin, and could not be made free indeede but by the ſonne <note place="margin">Ver. 36.</note> onely.

Me thinkes I heare the ſighes, and grones of a poore ſoule, lamentably complaining, that ſhee can finde no ende of her wretchedneſſe, no bottome of her running ſore. If ſhe heale vp one, two breake out for it. If ſhe make head againſt pride, couetouſneſſe ſetts vpon her behinde her backe. While ſhe is buſie with all the force ſhe can make, to withſtand the luſts of the fleſh, that outwardly aſſault her, her owne thoughts inwardly commit fornication. Though ſhee keepe her hands from murder: yet her tongue wounds deepely, and deadly, with euill ſpeeches. To conclude, when ſhee hath ouer night emptied the ſinke, in the morning ſhe findes it full againe. What may
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21009:91"/> wee ſay, to comfort one ſo diſtreſſed? Our Euangeliſt ſhall ſpeake for vs: <hi>In him was life.</hi> Art thou dead to righteouſneſſe? There is life in him. Dwelles there no good in thee? In him there is nothing but good. Neuer amplifie the ſtrength of thy corruption, as if the life that is in him could not ouercome it. Thinke not thy death can be ſtronger, then his life. Conſider with thy ſelfe, that it is no eaſie matter to diſpoſſeſſe him, that hath ſo long a time binne willingly enterteyned. Thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is of long continuance, and growth; the grace, that muſt cure it, newly planted in thee, and tender. If thy not beeing could not withſtand thy naturall life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall thy being naught, be able to keepe away from thee, the ſupernaturall life.</p>
            <p>But many occaſions will be offred vs, in the whole courſe of this Goſpell, to comfort, and ſtrengthen all them, that feele themſelues to bee ſpiritually dead, and deſire to haue life in Ieſus Chriſt. Giue me leaue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now in the beginning, to diſcouer the heretickes and idolaters, their erronious opinions, and conceiptes of our Sauiour, and of themſelues.

Alas; all this comes

Dares hee ſay, there is life in himſelfe, otherwiſe then by his depending vpon him, of whom our Euangeliſt ſaith, <hi>In him was life?</hi> The moſt excellent creatures, for their natures, are the Angells; yet had not they life in them, as the fountaine thereof. For many of them are ſpiritually dead, hauing no true holineſſe, or righteouſneſſe in them: and as for them, that continue in life, what haue they, that they haue not receiued? If it were poſſible to digge a new chanell for the ſea, and to empty that, wherein now the water runnes, into that new one ſo prepared, ſtopping vp the paſſage betwixt them; might wee account of this, as of the ſpring of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Let the breadth, length, and depth of it bee neuer ſo great, as long as the ſpringes are not there, it may bee a lake, or poole, and that a great one; but the ſea, or beginning of waters it cannot bee. So it is with all creatures whatſoeuer. If the life of righteouſneſſe, like the water of the ſea, could be conceiued to be in them, and they not in Chriſt; yet were not this the life, wee ſpeake of; which is the well-ſpring of life, and feeds all riuers with a continuall ſupply of liuing water. <hi>Of his fulneſſe</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) haue wee receiued;</hi> and ſo receiued, that as the ſunne beame hath all his light, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ioined to the body of the ſunne, from which if it ſhould bee ſeparted, it would bee wrapped vp in darkeneſſe: ſo haue wee life in Chriſt; who could not ſo largely impart it to all his members, if it were not his owne by nature, and in him, as in the firſt breeder of it. How can hee then bee any leſſe, then perfite God? Shall I now compare him with the Idolls of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?

How ſhould the world haue done for a new ſupply, when thou dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt? Me think it is againſt ſenſe, for any of the Heathen to boaſt of vertue, ſeeing it is more then apparant, that their Gods the fountaines of it were ſo dry, &amp; emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But I will deale with them more kindly: and not call them to account, where they had it; but onely make a little triall, whether they had it, or no. The triall is ſoone made. Take the opinions of the beſt, and moſt vertuous, that euerliued, without the life of righteouſneſſe in Chriſt, and you ſhall finde them full of error; I will not ſay in matter of religion, without which there can bee no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21009:92"/> holines, but in iudging of ordinarie duties, betwixt man and man. If I ſhould rehearſe ſome maine grounds, that the wiſeſt, and iuſteſt of them deliuered, vpon ripe, and <note place="margin">See Plato de Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>publ. &amp; Ariſto tel. politia.</note> aduiſed deliberation, in the greateſt points of the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſtates, you would hardly indure the hearing of them. But I will not enter into particulars, whereof there would bee no end. What life of righteouſneſſe could there be amongſt them, which alwaies allowed reuenge to bee moſt lawfull? I will onely ſay thus much in one worde, that they laboured to cleanſe the outſide of the veſſell, but within were full of all vncleanneſſe.</p>
            <p>It ſhall ſuffize then for the concluſion of this point, that the life of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, was in Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede; becauſe no man euer had it, that was not in him; &amp; many haue had, &amp; haue it in abundance, by depending wholy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. The principal point is yet behind, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the life of glory. Which though it properly belong to the world to come: yet there is one chiefe thing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteining therunto, which is to be had in this world, as an entrance to the other.

               <hi>ſaw that he was dead already, they brake not his legges.</hi> See I pray you; the champion, that ſhould ouercome death, is ſooner ſubdued by death, then either of theſe two ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie fellowes.

Doth this ſeeme vnpoſſible to thee? What wilt thou ſay then, if I tell thee of a greater matter? Hee ouercame death by dying. The ſame ſtroke, that tooke life from him, through him <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> ſlew death himſelfe, &amp; him that had power over death euen the diuell. Would you know more particularly, how that could bee? I may not enter into any large diſcourſe of the point: In one word it was thus, <hi>The ſting of death</hi> (as the Apoſtle taught vs) <hi>is ſinne:</hi> By which the diuell preuailed, to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, that had ſinned. This ſting was not onely blunted, and rebated, but pluckt out and caſt away by our Sauiour. For his death, being a ſacrifice for ſin, tooke ſinne quite away <note n="n" place="margin">Iob. 1. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſinnes of the world.</hi> So that now the name of death is more terrible, then the thing: there is more feare, then hurt in it. Tell me what it could indanger, or indamage thee, to haue a ſnake creepe vpon thee, yea if it were into thy boſom; ſo the ſting, teeth, and whatſoeuer els it hath power to hurt withall, were firſt pulled out? It might perhaps ſcarre thee, or make thee ſtart, as a litle cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will doe, if it be caſt (vpon a ſodaine) in thy face: but that is all the harme thou couldeſt haue by it.</p>
            <p>Death then is thus diſarmd by our Sauiour Chriſt: but the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, is by his reſurrection. If thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee death dead indeed, look into the graue, where Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus thy ſauiour was laid. There ſhewd death the vttermoſt of his power. He thought himſelfe ſure enough of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, when he had ſhut him vp without life in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, rolled a great ſtone to the mouth of it, and ſaw a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21009:94"/> guard of ſouldiers ſet to watch him well: there hee keeps him in that eſtate, the ſame day he was crucified, all the next, and the beginning of the third. What enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Surely if hee had bin put in aliue, hee would haue bin dead, by that time. There is no queſtion then, but that wee ſhall finde him dead in the graue. So though his diſciples. Who the next day, after the Iewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath, <note n="o" place="margin">Luke 24. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Early in the morning, came vnto the Sepulchre, and brought the odors, which they had prepared, to embalme his body withall;</hi> They made no doubt, but they ſhould finde him, <note n="p" place="margin">Mark. 16. 1. Mark 15. 47.</note> 
               <hi>where they had ſeene him laid.</hi> For dead men are no ſtarters. Onely their feare was, that they ſhould not be able to roule away the ſtone, from the doore of the Sepulchre. But that feare laſted not long. <note n="q" place="margin">Luke 24. 2. 3</note> 
               <hi>When they looked, they ſaw that the ſtone was rolled away: And they went in, but found not the body of the Lord IESVS.</hi> What ſhould they now thinke? Or how ſhould they come to learne, what was become of him? Sure they were, that there hee was laid; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, had no power to conuay himſelfe away from thence. The likelieſt was, that ſome body had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him vp, and caried him away to ſome other place.

Mary ſtaies: &amp; to her Ieſus diſcouers himſelfe. What ſhould I make many words? The proofe of this point, belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to an other place. Death had done his worſt: &amp; in deſpite of him, the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21009:94"/> Lord Ieſus is riſen again, leauing him aſhamed, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. To <note n="e" place="margin">Luk 24. 5. 6.</note> this the Angels beare witnes; <hi>Why ſeeke yee him, that liueth, among the dead? He is not here n but is riſen.</hi> I ſpeake of knowne things, it is enough to name them. Wee ſee for all this goodly diſcourſe, that death ſtill ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth vpon all men: let them be neuer ſo well ſetled in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he plucks them vp, &amp; carries them away with him into the graue. What is become of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? where is his bleſſed mother the virgin? Is there life in the head, when the members of the body die ſo faſt, euery day? And not one or two, a ioint or a finger, or a limme, but the very principall parts, yea all, one, &amp; other? Dooſt thou doubt, whether there bee life in him or no, who hath wraſtled with death, and ouerthrowne him? Can death preuaile againſt him, now he liueth, whom he could not keepe in ſubiection, when he had him dead &amp; buried? <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 5. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dyeth no more; death hath no more dominion ouer him. For, in that hee died, he died once to ſinne, but in that be liueth, hee liueth to God.</hi> Sinne had his due; a ſacrifice of infinit worth, to pay the price of mans redemption: now muſt God alſo haue his due, that hee, that liueth to him, may liue for euer. But I would not haue any man ſo much deceiue himſelfe, as to imagin, that the dying of them, which are in Chriſt, is an argument of the continuance of the authoritie, or power of death. No, no, beloued, there is an other reaſon of this diſſolution. Alas, alas, death doth not aduance his owne eſtate, and kingdome by this meanes, but ſerues the Lords turne, to bring his purpoſe to effect. It fares with him, in this caſe, as it did in the death of our Sauiour. That which hee thought to eſtabliſh his power by, by that he deſtroied it. So is it in the death of thoſe, that are Chriſts. The body, as now it is, is neither capable of immortalitie, and fit for the ſeruice of ſinne. How ſhall it be prepared to receiue the one; how purged and clenſed from the other, but by death? <hi>Fleſh &amp; bloud</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:21009:95"/> (<note n="x" place="margin">1.

Die then, that thou maieſt be ridde of mortalitie. Art thou affraid? Of what? Leaſt death ſhould be too ſtrong for thee, if he once ger thee into his clouches? Haſt thou not an example in Chriſt? <hi>I am aliue</hi> (<note n="y" place="margin">Reuel. 1. 18.</note> ſaith he) <hi>but I was dead; and beholde I am aliue for euermore.</hi> But thou feareſt, becauſe thy body ſhall be turned into duſt.

Where then ſhall the freſh greene blade appeare? When ſhall the ſtalke grow vp? When ſhall it eare? When ſhall it flower? Shall not all this glorie bee loſt, if the graine bee not ſowed in the furrowes of the earth? And art thou ſo, I will not ſay fearefull, but foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and childiſh, that thou dareſt not die once, that thou maiſt liue for euer? Plucke vp thy ſpirits, and bee no longer a childe, but a man: were it not better for thee to die a thouſand deaths, then to bee continually diſquieted with the motions of thy corruption? Thou haſt now ſome life of Chriſt in thee, by the power of his ſpirit, which inables thee to fight againſt ſinne, and to preuaile. But there is no finall ſubduing of it, till the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be deſtroied, which doth ſo incline, &amp; draw thee to the ſeruice thereof: Neither hath the ſpirit of God quiet, or full poſſeſſion of thy ſoule, as long as that corruption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides therein. And that, as it was bred with thee, muſt die with thee: there is no other courſe appointed by God, to rid thee of it. I doubt not, but thou art now reſolu'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhall pleaſe God: ſeeing there is no way to life, but by it: &amp; with this reſolution, I leaue thee, that I may ſpeak a word, or two to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are yet out of Chriſt</p>
            <p>And how ſhall I addreſſe my ſpeech vnto them? It is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:21009:95"/> needleſſe to inflame them with a deſire of life. For they are wholly poſſeſt with that already, It is in vaine to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them they ſhall neuer die, if they be in Chriſt. For all experience teacheth the contrary. Shall I exhort them not to feare that, which they cannot auoide? They may learne that in the ſchoole of reaſon: what remaines then? At the leaſt giue mee leaue to aduiſe you, how you may make the beſt of that, which can by no meanes bee eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. You are reſolued, there is no way with you, but one. Die you muſt, and it is vncertaine how ſoone. Yet if you may die ſo, that you may be ſure to liue againe, &amp; that for euer, what hurt can there be in death, what feare ſhould there be of it? A crab ſtock, that hauing his head, boughts, &amp; armes cut off, is graffed with a pippin, or ſome other dainty fruit, can not reaſonably complaine of hurt, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath great cauſe to reioice, and glory. Hath hee any wrong done him, that hauing his cottage of clay pulled downe, hath a goodly palace of ſtone built for his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? But theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will not beleeue, that there is any ſuch life in Chriſt. I would to God I were able to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to make ſom litle trial. O! if they would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, but to reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him for life, how quickly ſhould they find his promiſe true, &amp; certain? Be perſwaded, be intreated I beſeech you by the loue of life, which you ſo deſire: what ſhall you loſe by it? If that we preach be falſe, yet ſhal the reſt of your yeers be ſpent in more hope, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort.

            <p>I am come now at the laſt, to the chiefe point of all, which is life euerlaſting; begun (as I ſaid ere-while) in this world, by the forgiuing of ſin, &amp; perfited in the next by the giuing of glory.

Shortly for the proofe of the point, that eternall death, and condemnation are compriz'd in that threating, <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death;</hi> I appeale to the whole courſe of the ſcripture, and the ioint conſent of all, that euer profeſt true religion, Iewes &amp; Chriſtians. But it is manifeſt enough, by the deliuerance, wee haue through Chriſt; that I may make one labour of two. <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>God ſent not his Sonne into the world, that he ſhould condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved. He</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> 
               <hi>that beleeueth in him, ſhall not be condemned: but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth not, is condemned already.</hi> Yea ſuch is the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we haue by Ieſus Chriſt, <note n="c" place="margin">Iob. 5. 24.</note> that he, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, <hi>hath paſſed from death to life.</hi> What is this paſſing from death to life, but obteining forgiuenes of ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to God? whoſe wrath otherwiſe abideth in vs, to condemnation. <hi>God hath ſet forth Ieſus Chriſt</hi> (<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to bee apropitiation, through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteouſneſſe by the forgiuenes of ſinnes, that are paſt,</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>If when wee were enemies, wee were reconciled to God by the death of his ſonne, much more, beeing reeonciled we ſhall be ſaued by his life.</hi> But I forget my ſelfe, in ſtaying too long in this diſcourſe; wherein the new Teſtament is ſo plentifull and eaſie to bee vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>Neither is the point of euerlaſting life, either harder, or rarer. This one Goſpell of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> hath not ſo few as twenty ſeuerall places to that purpoſe. <note n="f" place="margin">10. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>God ſo loued the world, that hee gaue his onely begotten ſonne, that who ſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh but haue life euerlaſting. This is the will of him, that ſent me, that euery man which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſon &amp; beleeueth in him, ſhould haue euerlaſting life, &amp;</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 40.</note> 
               <hi>I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> Look not that I ſhould go forward in this courſe, or ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d time in amplifying the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable glory of that life. For the one I refer al men to the reading of this goſpel; eſpecially the chapters I named
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:21009:96"/> before: and concerning the other, all I can poſſibly ſay of it, is leſſe then nothing in compariſon of the thing it ſelfe. Therefore alſo I hold it in a manner needleſſe, to enter into any courſe of exhortation. For who can hear of theſe kindes of life in our Sauiour; and not be carried to him, for the enioying of them, with all ſpeed, and means, he can poſſibly make? Let it be a ſmall thing, for a man to bee dead in ſinne, becauſe perhaps he feeles it not. Let the life of righteouſneſſe be little accounted of; ov reaſon of the pleaſure we take in ſinning. Let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpie bodily death, as a common matter. Let vs not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard the reſurrection of the fleſh, as long as the ſoul is immortall. Shall not feare of damnation for euer in hel fire affright vs? Shall not hope of eternall ioy in heauen delight vs? Is it nothing to indure moſt horrible torments, without eaſe or ende? Is it nothing to be partaker of ſuch pleaſure, as cannot be conceiu'd, without danger, or feare of change? What is the immortality of the ſoule, of which thou bragſt, but an immortall miſerie? The more thou art perſwaded of the euerlaſting continuance thereof, the greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thou haſt of thine owne endleſſe calamitie: Whereas if once thou come to bee ioined to Chriſt; the farderthou ſeeſt into the continuance of thy life, the more thou art inflamed with a delight to liue. But now I haue brought thee where this life is to bee had, I will ſhew thee how it is to bee attained</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In him was life:</hi> Where though it may ſeeme that the Euangeliſt ſayes no more, but <hi>he is life, or life is by him,</hi> yet indeed the ſpeech is more ſignificant. Firſt in reſpect of life, the manner of ſpeaking makes difference in the thing. For when the ſcripture ſaith that Chriſt is life, the word is to be taken for the cauſe of life. <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn. 11. 25.</note> 
               <hi>I am the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the life,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour: and again, <hi>I <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6.</note> am the way, the truth &amp; the life.</hi> So ſpeakes <note n="k" place="margin">Col. 3. 4.</note> the Apoſtle of him. <hi>When Chriſt your life ſhal appear.</hi> Who ſee not, that by life
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:21009:97"/> in theſe places, the author of life, or life, as it is in the cauſe thereof, is vnderſtood? But in the other phraſe, the ſame thing is noted, as it is imparted by him to vs. <note n="l" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5, 11.</note> 
               <hi>God hath giuen vs euerlaſting life, and that life is in his ſonne.</hi> Wee haue example of both theſe in one place; <hi>yee are dead</hi> (ſaith <note n="m" place="margin">Col. 3. 3. 4.</note> the Apoſtle) <hi>and your life is hidwith God in Chriſt:</hi> What life? That ſame life, which Chriſt hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to you, and by which you liue. What followes? <hi>When Chriſt your life ſhall appeare.</hi> How is Chriſt their life? By giuing them life. And as in this kind of ſpeech wee may eaſily diſcerne ſome reaſon of the difference, that the ſcripture obſerueth; ſo may wee alſo in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sometimes <note n="n" place="margin">Cor. 1. 30.</note> the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt is made vnto vs wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> What is this els, but that wee receiue theſe things from Chriſt, as the autor, and cauſe therof. Somtimes, life is ſaid to be in him: ſo we are ſaid to bee in Chriſt Ieſus; <note n="o" place="margin">1 Ioh, 5. 11.</note> 
               <hi>yee are of him in Chriſt;</hi> as in the place I named before: <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 8, 1.</note> 
               <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt.</hi> Now in theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the like, not onely the effect, but alſo the manner of our comming by it is ſignified. Will you haue a plaine example of it? <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. x1.</note> 
               <hi>Since by man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> We haue here the effect of Adams tranſgreſſion, and of Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The next verſe ſhewes the maner of both more <note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> euidently. For as in Adam (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all men die, euen ſo in Chriſt ſhall all bee made aliue.</hi> How die all men in <hi>Adam;</hi> but <note n="r" place="margin">Rom 5. 12.</note> as beeing one with <hi>Adam,</hi> in whoſe loines they were, when he ſinned, <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb. 7, 9. 10.</hi>
               </note> as <hi>Leui</hi> was in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abrahams,</hi> when he paide tithes to <hi>Melchiſedech?</hi> So are all raiſed againe in Chriſt. Not ſimply all: but all his. <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 23.</note> 
               <hi>The firſt fruits is Chriſts: then they, that are Chriſts, at his comming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wouldeſt thou then bee made partaker of this life, of which thou haſt heard ſo many admirable, and glorious things? This life is in Chriſt. How wilt thou do to fetch
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21009:97"/> it out of him? Deceiue not thy ſelfe: it is not ſo to he had. Hee, that will enioy the life, which is in Chriſt, muſt not thinke to come to him, and take a ſnatch, and carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him. He keepes it cloſe ſhut vp within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Not refuſing to impart it to other, but deſiring to ioine other to him, that they may bee ſure to holde faſt for euer, that hee giues them. If hee ſhould commit it to thy cuſtodie, and let thee depart from him with it, what wouldeſt thou doe, or what meanes couldeſt thou vſe, to keepe it ſafe? Satan is craftie, and mighty. It is a great venture, but either hee would coſin thee of it by deceipt, or robbe thee of it by force. What ſay I a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? It is out of queſtion, thou wouldeſt neuer be able to keepe it from him. If thou haue any experience of his vndermining, and aſſaulting thee, thou knoweſt how hardly, and with what adoe, it is now held, when yet thou art knit by faith to him, in whom the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of it is. Dooſt thou not feele how ſtrongly he pulls, to rent thee from him, that ſometimes thou canſt ſcarce tell, whether hee haue ſeuered thee from him, or no?

Alas poore man, thou wilt keepe it but a little while l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis, if thou haue no better help then thine owne. But if thou cleaue faſt to Ieſus Chriſt, and ſtirre not an inch, or an hayres bredth from his ſide, thou maiſt perhaps heare the diuell roaring at thy backe, or ſee him running vp and downe prying, and ſeeking ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to ſeize vpon thee: it may bee hee will offer to ſnatch at thee, and lay holde vpon thee; cling to rhy Sauiour, as the childe dooth to the mother, when hee is in feare: and then doubt not, but he, that is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all, will keepe thee out of Satans iawes, maugre all his power, and malice.</p>
            <p>Beare with mee, I pray you, if I ſeeme to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large in this point. I feele ſuch an increaſe of comfort, and aſſurance in the meditation of this matter, that I can not leaue it, till I haue lookt a little neerer into the particulars thereof, eſpecially thoſe, that concerne the temporall death of the body, and the eternall both of it, and the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now the life, whereby wee are deliuered from the one and the other death, as it hath oft bin ſaid, is in Chriſt. For the better, and fuller conceiuing whereof, wee muſt remember, that faith, whereby we are ioined vnto Chriſt, that wee may partake of that life, which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21009:98"/> is in him, maketh vs al one with him. There are a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudes, by which the Scripture expreſſeth this ſpirituall coniunction: the one is that bond, which is betwixt man, and wife; by which they, that were two, become one fleſh. This is moſt excellently ſet out by <note n="x" place="margin">Eph. 5. 23.</note> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle S. <hi>Paul;</hi> where he ſhewes, that <hi>Chriſt is the head of the Church, as the husband thereof; that the Lord nouriſheth, &amp; cheriſheth it, as his owne fleſh.</hi> And no maruaile though he do ſo: <hi>For</hi> (as it followes) <hi>we are members of his body, of his fleſh, &amp; of his bones.</hi> Yea ſo members of them, that wee are one fleſh with him, by reaſon of this bond of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that ſo chaynes, &amp; links vs together. No man can be ſo fond, as to vnderſtand this of our humane nature; as if therefore wee were ſaid to bee one fleſh, becauſe hee &amp; wee are of the ſame nature. For neither are all men one fleſh, though they be all of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: &amp; if the Apoſtle had intended to ſpeake of that point, he would not haue ſaid, that wee are bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh; but rather that he was bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh. For it is well knowne to al men, that, in regard of the nature of man, they, that are the Church, I meane a great part of them, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al that died before our Sauiour, and were partakers of the life we ſpeake of, had it, before he was made man: &amp; but for their ſake, &amp; ſome others, hee had not taken that nature vpon him. <hi>But the myſticall coniunction, whereof</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Eph. 5. 23. 29</note> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle profeſſeth to ſpeak in that place, hath the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ground in Chriſt, &amp; not in vs. Hee is the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, we are the wife; <hi>Eue</hi> was bone of <hi>Adams</hi> bone, not <note place="margin">Verſe. 30.</note> he of hers. Yet, when they were ioined together in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they were both but one fleſh. It is then apparant <note place="margin">verſe. 31.</note> by this ſimilitude, that we being thus ſpiritually become one with Chr. haue the ſame life, which is in him; as the <note place="margin">Verſe. 32.</note> wife hath the ſame fleſh, or rather is the ſame fleſh with her husband. The other ſimilitude is of the head &amp; body; which liue by the ſame ſpirit of life. reſting originally
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21009:99"/> in the head, and from thence diſperſing it ſelfe into all the members of the body. This alſo, the ſame Apoſtle ſetteth forth in the ſame Epiſtle. It will be ſufficient to rehearſe his words. <hi>Let vs</hi> (<note n="y" place="margin">Fph 4. 35. 16</note> ſaith he) <hi>follow the truth, in loue, and in all things grow vp into him, which is the head, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Chriſt.

            <p>Giue eare now with attention, and take knowledge of the aſſurance of your life. Why do you ſhrinke, and quake, at the mention of death? Euen when your are dead, you are ſtill aliue. Are you not one with Ieſus Chriſt? Are you not bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh? Are not you and he one fleſh? Doth not euery man nouriſh, &amp; cheriſh his owne fleſh: And will Chriſt (thinke you) ſuffer his fleſh to be deſtroied by death? What doſt thou tell me, of the decay of thy ſtrength? that thy ſight waxeth dimme, thy leggs feeble, thine armes weake, and all thy ſenſes begin to fayle thee? Is not Chriſt aliue? Or canſt thou dy, as long as hee liues? Thou art but the leaſt part of thy ſelfe; thy husband is thy head, and thy life. And whereas thou art now a-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not for thy deſtruction, but for the aboliſhing of that which makes thee ſubiect to dy. Chriſt thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band doth not meane to forgoe thee, but to ioyne thee neerer to him. Wouldſt thou bring a mortall carcaſe into heauen? Wouldeſt thou bee continually in danger of dying? Is it not better once to endure it, then alwaies to feare it? A quarter of an howers worke, will rid thee of all paine for euer. How wilt thou wonder at thy ſelfe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21009:99"/> when thou ſhalt behold the glory of that body, which thou left'ſt naked, and miſerable? Shal I need to put thee in minde of thy happineſſe? Doſt thou remember, that thou art a part of Ieſus Chriſts body? Hath he any dead part trow'ſt thou? Thou canſt not imagin, that any man of reaſon would ſuffer his enimies to diſmember his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or to depriue the leaſt finger he hath of life or ſenſe? How then ſhould Chriſt endure ſuch a mayme? But what talke I of bereauing his members of life? As if it were any way poſſible, that deathſhould be in that part in which life is continued? Wait the time, that God hath appointed for thy quicking. Thou art but dreſſing, &amp; attiring, that thou mai'ſt be a fit Bride, for an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bridegrome.</p>
            <p>As for condemnation to hel fire, the ſecond death, be not ſo iniurious to the Maieſtie of Chriſt, as once to think, that any member of his body can bee lyable to damnation. <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
               <hi>There is no condemnation to them, that are in Chriſt.</hi> VVho ſhall laye anything to the charge of Ieſus Chriſt? Canſt thou bee condemned, and hee acquited? Can the head bee in heauen, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in hell? <hi>Father</hi> (<note n="d" place="margin">Iohn. 17. 24.</note> ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>I will that they, which thou haſt giuen me, be with me, euen where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou haſt giuen me.</hi> Can the firſt fruites bee holy, and the lumpe vncleane? Can the head raigne in glory, and the members bee plunged in the pit of damnation? Aſſure thy ſelfe, if there bee life in Chriſt, &amp; thou one of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, thy part is in it. He bought thee too deare, now to loſe thee, or let thee be taken from him. Beſides, hee hath openly confeſt; that hee receiued a charge from God his Father, to ſee that none ſhoulde periſh, that belieu'd in him: and <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 6 40.</note> hee hath profeſt, that hee will diſcharge the truſt repoſed in him. <hi>I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.

            <p>A gueſt, that hath life in him, as in the fountaine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from whence it floweth to al thoſe, that are io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to him. For although our Euangeliſt ſay, <hi>In him was life</hi> &amp; not <hi>Is life;</hi> yet he may no more be thought once to haue had it, &amp; now to be without it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once to haue bin God, &amp; now not to be ſo. But that all doubt of this matter may be taken a way, we muſt call to minde that which we heard before of the reaſons, why this maner of ſpeech is vſed. Firſt then (for I will now ſett it in the firſt place, becauſe it is the plaineſt, &amp; hath leaſt need of any explication) we may well, &amp; reaſonably imagine, that the Evangeliſt continues his former kind of ſpeech; <hi>The word was in the beginning, was with God, was God. All things were made by him, nothing was made without him.</hi> was it not fitter then, to ſay, <hi>In him was, then, in him is life,</hi> that the whole deſcription of him may bee deliuered in the like tearmes? This might ſerue, in my poor opinion, to ſatiſfy any man, concerning the worde. Yet becauſe there are ſome other reaſons of it alleaged, &amp; thoſe both true, for the doctrine they teach, &amp; not vnfit for the text it ſelfe, I will make bold to ſtand a little vpon them; the rather becauſe I perceiue I ſhall not end theſe 2 verſes in this one exerciſe, as I purpoſed, and deſired to do.</p>
            <p>The former reaſon of the word <hi>was</hi> depends vpon the like courſe the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt takes in the reſt of his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: thoſe that now I am to handle, concerne the time, either before our Sauiours being in the world, or while he was in the world. The time before, either reaches to eternity, before all beginning, or at the leaſt makes it ſelf equall to the continuance of the world, after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> til the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt in the fleſh. If wee apply it to eternity, who can doubt, but life was always in him who only liues of himſelf, &amp; giues life both te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral &amp;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21009:100"/> ſpiritual to al, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery one that hath it. But becauſe this maner of giuing life is an effect of Godhead; &amp; ſo, common to him with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt and not a matter belonging properly to his perſon, nor any worke of his mediatorſhip: I will leaue it, as not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this place; and come to a ſecond conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life being in him from all eternity, as in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator betwixt God and man. In what reſpect then may it be truly, and fitly ſaid, that life was in him from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? In reſpect of the eternall decree of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he determined to reſtore to life thoſe, whome hee choſe therevnto by the mediation of his Sonne, the word, of whom we ſpeake. <hi>Of</hi> this <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29. 30</note> the Apoſtle ſpeaks: <hi>Thoſe, whom he knewe before, he did alſo predeſtinate, to bee made like to the image of his Sonne, that he might bee the firſt borne among many children.</hi> Vpon this predeſtination (as the Apoſtle adds) followeth calling, iuſtifying, and at the laſt glorifying, which is the higheſt degree of the life, that is in Chriſt. But in <note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 1. 3. 4.</note> an other place hee ſpeakes more plainely. <hi>Bleſſed be God, euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; which hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heauenly things in Chriſt: As he hath choſen vs in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before the foundation of the world.</hi> Therefore doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aſcribe the appointing of the meanes, and the execution of it, according to the appointment, to the foreknowledge of God. <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Him haue ye taken by the hands of the wicked, being deliuered by the determinate counſaile, and fore knowledge of God.</hi> The ſame is acknowledged by the ioynt confeſſion of the Apoſtles, where they ſay, that <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilat, the Gentiles, and the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, gathered them ſelues together againſt the holy Sonne of</hi>

               <hi>God Ieſus (whom God had annointed) to doe what ſoeuer the hande, and counſaile of the Lorde had determined afore to bee donne.</hi> VVorthily then doth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> avouch, that <hi>life was in him; yea</hi> before any time was, <hi>life was in him.</hi>

               <hi>God ſent his Sonne.</hi> Life did not then begin to be in him, but to ſhew it ſelfe to be in him, <note n="k" place="margin">Rom 3 25.</note> 
               <hi>God ſet him forth</hi> (by his incarnation) <hi>to be apropitiation.</hi> Life was in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in regard of Gods eternall counſaile; but not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, nor manifeſted to the world, no nor thoſe works of his, which were to bring life, performed: Yet euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was life in him.</p>
            <p>If it ſeeme to any man ſomewhat ouermuch, to go ſo far for the Euangeliſts meaning, let him ſhorten his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, &amp; containe him ſelfe, within the compaſſe of the world created. Shal we not find ſufficient reaſon of this ſpeech <hi>In him was life,</hi> though wee goe not out of the world? yes out of doubt, very ſufficient. For ſeeing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy Patriarchs, and holy Prophets, many true Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits, &amp; Sonns of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith, as well as by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, departed out of this worlde, before our Sauiour came into it, to performe the foreappointed worke of redemption, either theſe muſt haue died without life, &amp; ſo alwaies continue dead, or there was life in him, before he was incarnat. <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 10. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Many Prophets, and Kings deſired to ſee and heare him,</hi> at the Apoſtles while hee liued heere, ſaw and heard. Surely then they were not ignorant of him, and that life was in him. But did they not ſee him? By one, iudge of the reſt, <hi>Your Father Abraham</hi>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21009:101"/> may wee ſafely, and truely conclude, that there <hi>was life in him,</hi> before he was in the nature of man.</p>
            <p>But howſoeuer it be true, &amp; certaine, that <hi>life was in him,</hi> both from all eternity, in regard of the counſaile of God, which is as ancient as himſelfe; &amp; in effect, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them, that from time to time were partakers of it, euen from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Iohn Baptist:</hi> yet it was then moſt properly in him, when hauing taken our nature vpon him, he ouercame death, and him, that had power ouer it, the Deuill. This was that, which thoſe Kings, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets deſired, and longed to ſee. This was that, which good olde Simeon ſo reioyced at, that he was ready to depart out of this life with full ſatisfaction, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe, when he had ſeene the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the nature of man: <hi>Lord</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Luk. 2. 29. 39</note> (ſaith he) <hi>now letteſt thou thy ſeruant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eies haue ſeen thy ſaluation.</hi> The holy man had a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeu'd by faith, that ſaluation was to come, and in hope with patience waited for the comming of it, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſaw it til that time. Indeed how ſhould he? For it was neuer to be ſeene, till then. How could it be? For it neuer was fully, &amp; perfitly till then. It was not enough for the Son of God, that he had infinite power, as God, to giue life to whom he would, to repair the ruins of his image in man, by clenſing him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin, &amp; cloathing him with righteouſnes, by raiſing him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, as he firſt breath ed the ſoule of life into him, by vouchſafing him a place in heauen, which was at his command, that had made it. Al this I ſay would not ſerue the turne, that the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt might ſay as he doth, <hi>In him was life.</hi> For the Lorde God, Father, Son, &amp; Holy ghoſt, had appointed another courſe of giuing life, another meanes of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to be perform'd by the Son of God, ſitting in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but to be wrought here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, in the ſame nature, that had ſind, &amp; was dead. He, that made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy, &amp; righteous at his creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, could, by the ſame powr, haue reſtord to him
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21009:102"/> his original righteouſnes in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But it pleaſ'd him to doe it after an other maner; wherof more hereafter in due place. To ſay al at once; ſeing by man cam death, God would haue life to come by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Let it be graunted (may ſome man ſay) that there was no poſſibility of life, but by the death of the Sonne of God, and that the Sonne of God could not dye, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he became man; yet might the Evangeliſt haue wel ſaid, <hi>In him is life.</hi> For ſince it is confeſt, that hee tooke the nature of man, and continues ſtill in heauen in that nature, ſurely life was no more in him, while hee was heere, then it is in him, now he is gone from hence. Why then ſaith <hi>S. Iohn, In him was life?</hi> I anſwere in one word, though life be ſtill in him; yet it is in reſpect of that, which he performed, when he was here on the earth. Here he tooke, and ſanctified our nature; here hee bare the chaſtiſement of our peace? here he offred vp that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable ſacrifice, for the purging of our ſinnes: Here hee triumphed on the Croſſe ouer all principalities, and powers: Heere hee roſe out of the graue from death to life: Only one thing, which here poſſibly could not be don, he hath done being gon from hence; that is he hath taken poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our inheritance in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; waites there to receiue vs into his owne glory. The Euangeliſt therefore writing the hiſtory of his life &amp; death, while he was here in the world, ſpeaks of him, as of one that was, &amp; is not. But of this enough before.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now proceed to the later part of this fourth verſe; <hi>And that life was the light of men:</hi> But I find my ſelf ſo much ouertaken by the time, that it is in vain to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it. I will I therefore content my ſelfe with ſome word of exhortation, whereby wee maie bee ſtirred vp to the embracing of that life, which was in Chriſt. To which purpoſe what ſhal I need to ſay much? The mat ter dooth ſo highly commende it ſelfe, that it refuſeth to be entreated for. Looke not therefore, that I ſhoulde
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21009:102"/> deſire you to bee willing to liue. Nay, bee vnwilling if you can. Doe but propound the matter to your own hearts, and you will not chooſe, but like of it. And yet, mee thinkes I ſee no man make any great haſte. Shall I wonder or complayne? It is ſtrange, that life, life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ſhould bee ſo little ſet by. It is lamentable that death, eternall death ſhould ſo little bee feared. If it were any long Iorney, or daungerous way, if hard to come by, or ſoone loſt againe, there might bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome colour of excuſe for this backewardneſſe. But when the thing it ſelfe is neere at hand, the way to it ſafe, the meanes of attaining to it eaſie, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it ſure, who can excuſe himſelfe to himſelfe (I ſay not to God) if hee fayle of ſo glorious a treaſure? <hi>Do wee not beleeue the Euangeliſt, that there is life in him?</hi> Doe wee flatter our ſelues with a conceite, that there is life in vs? Why come wee to heare that, which when wee haue heard, wee will not credite? why make wee a ſhew, as if wee ſtood in need of life from Chriſt, when wee thinke our ſelues, ſped of it already? Perhaps it ſeemes the leſſe worth, becauſe it is offered. Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought, that the kindneſſe of the giuer ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the valew of the gift? Condemne thy ſelfe, for not ſeeking to him; not him, for ſeeking to thee. That hee reueales to thee, hee conceales from many. That which thou vnthankefully refuſeſt, many thouſandes would moſt thankefully receiue. O the frowardneſſe of the hearts of men! O the blindneſſe of their minds! If this life were in God, they would tremble to come neere him for it, becauſe of his dreadfull maieſtie. Now it is in a man (leaſt happely they ſhould be too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd) they diſdaine to take it of him, by reaſon of his meaneneſſe. <note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 11. 19.</note>

According to the nature of light, <hi>Hee ſhines in darkenes.</hi> But the darkeneſſe will not bee inlightned. Of the firſt of theſe points concerning <hi>life in him,</hi> I ſpake in my laſt Sermon: now let vs proceede to that, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes touching light. And therein (keeping our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe of handling the Clauſes ſeuerally, as they lye) wee muſt firſt labour to vnderſtand the words, then ſeeke out the Euangeliſts meaning. The wordes direct vs to inquire what life it is, that is heere ſpoken
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21009:104"/> of; to conſider what is ſaide of it: that <hi>it is light,</hi> and <hi>the light of men.</hi> For the firſt worde, a little labour will ſerue: becauſe there would haue beene no doubt of the meaning, but for the needleſſe curioſitie of ſome, that make themſelues worke, where they finde none. What reaſonable man would make any queſtion, but that the Euangeliſt in both clauſes ſpeakes of the ſame <hi>life? In him was life.</hi> What followes? <hi>And that life was the light of men.</hi> What life thinke you? Any other, then that he named preſently, yea immediatly before? I, ſay theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; elſe, why hath hee added the article in this later part, which he had omitted in the former? what needs all this adoe about the Article? How vaine and falſe the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is, that hath no better ground, then the preſence or abſence of the article, I ſhewed in expounding the firſt verſe, againſt the <hi>Arians.</hi> Here is leſſe colour for the profe of any difference. Firſt, the courſe of writing, which the Euangeliſt hath hitherto kept, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Goſpell, makes it euident, and certaine, that the ſame <hi>life</hi> is meant in both places. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God.</hi> It is ridiculous to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that <hi>the word,</hi> which was in <hi>the beginning,</hi> ſhould be any other word, then that, which was with God. <hi>By him were all things made, &amp; without him was nothing made, that was made.</hi> Without whom was nothing made? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, by whom all things were made. So in this verſe the repeating of the ſame word teacheth vs, that the ſame life, and no other, is ſignified. Secondly, there may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon be giuen, why it was requiſite, if not nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary, to adde the article, in the later part. Let vs make the Euangeliſt ſpeake without it. <hi>In him was life.</hi> What then? <hi>And life was the light of men.</hi> Who can reaſonably conceiue, what life he meanes? In the firſt verſe I ſhew'd that there was good reaſon to place the Article before <hi>word,</hi> that it might the eaſilier appeare, whether the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt intended to ſay, <hi>The word was God, or God was</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:21009:104"/>

Hee could not then ſpeake otherwiſe, if hee would ſpeake plaine: <hi>In him was life, and that life was the light of men.</hi> As for his omitting it in the firſt place, it is vſuall with all our authors both diuine and humane, to put it in, or leaue it out, at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>life</hi> then, which was in the Word, was alſo the light of men. But, what light was that? For the word may bee taken in diuers ſenſes.

But of this light there is no occaſion to ſpeake in this place; neither was it in the Meſſiah, and it is common to all creatures, that can ſee, as well as to men. From this proper ſignification, the word is applyed, by a certaine reſemblance, to note out the inſtructing, and teaching of the minde, which is as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Of this ſpeakes <note n="f" place="margin">Eceleſ. 1. 13.</note> the wiſe King; <hi>I gaue heart</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>to ſearch, and finde out wiſedome by all things, that are done vnder the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> This is that <hi>wiſedome of the Aegyptians,</hi>

Cor. 2. 7.</note> the Apoſtle) <hi>euen the hidden wiſedome, which God had determined, before the world, to our glory.</hi> Theſe are <hi>the treaſures of wiſdome, and knowledge, al which</hi>

               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:21009:105"/> 
               <hi>hath beene hid in God, who hath created all thinges by Ieſus Chriſt; to the intent, that now vnto principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in heauenly places might be knowne, by the Church, the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi> Theſe are the two kindes of light whereby the vnderſtanding of man is inlightned, and inſtructed. The queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, whether of theſe two, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt meaneth in this place.</p>
            <p>A queſtion eaſie to bee aunſwered, will ſome man ſay. For ſeeing it was proued, that by life in the former part of the verſe, not the naturall, but the ſupernaturall life was ſignified; who can doubt but the light in this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, is of the ſame nature? It is ſo, doubtleſſe; and therefore wee ſhall neede to ſtand the leſſe while, vpon the proofe thereof. Yet becauſe it is (for the moſt parte) otherwiſe vnderſtood, and that one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall ground of interpreting that <hi>life,</hi> to bee the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, or ſpirituall life, was fetcht out of this place; I thinke it will not bee amiſſe to ſay ſomewhat, for the better clearing of the matter. Firſt then, <hi>the light,</hi> here ſpoken of, muſt bee conceiued to bee ſuch, as the Scripture otherwhere ordinarily ſignifieth by the ſame word. For it were ſtrange, and againſt reaſon, to giue the worde ſuch a ſenſe, in this place, as it hath not any where elſe in the whole volume of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I denye not, but it is poſſible, that ſome one place may haue a word in ſuch a meaning, as is not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to bee found. But this I ſay, that hee, which will aduenture vpon any ſuch vnvſuall, and rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, had neede bee ſure, that the place will not admitany ordinarie interpretation of the word. Here is no ſuch neceſſitie. All things are agreeable to the Euangeliſts purpoſe, and circumſtances of the text, if wee take the word <hi>light</hi> in that ſenſe, which it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beares euerie where in the Scripture. Let vs inquire then, how it is ordinarily taken. Surely, for that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall light, which the Lord reuealeth, for the making

As for the other ſignification of the worde, that by light, natural reaſon or knowledge ſhould be meant, I am certainly perſwaded, that it is not once to be found in the whole courſe of the ſcripture. What other proofe of this point ſhall I neede, then that they, which expound this place of ſuch naturall light, can alleadge no text, but one, that may ſeeme to make any thing for that purpoſe?

               </gap> how we may gather goods? But what doe the godly pray for? That the Lord would giue them an increaſe of humane wiſedome? Indeede this praier had not bin vnfit for a Philoſopher, who knew nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor eſteemed any thing more, then ſuch manner of knowledge. But the thoughts of Gods children are raiſed higher, and their happineſſe is of an other kinde. The knowledge, and fauour of GOD, are the matters, they labour for. That is the light, which they would haue to ſhine vpon them, and in them; without which they account themſelues to bee in pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21009:107"/> darkneſſe, though they had more knowledge of all other matters, then al men in the world beſide. This was fit to bee oppoſed to the vaine wiſhes of carnall worldlings.</p>
            <p>If then the worde be ordinarily taken for ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or ſpirituall light, ſeldome or neuer for the naturall light of reaſon, and humane knowledge; how ſhould wee vnderſtand it, in this place, but according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vſe of it in the ſcripture, for that light which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from God by reuelation? Whereof that wee may be the better perſwaded; let vs conſider the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worde, as it is commonly vſed by <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 19. 20. 21.</note> this writer. <hi>This is condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loued darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> So in the two next verſes.

               <hi>were hid from the wiſe, and men of vnderſtanding, and reuealed to the ſimple,</hi> that had no learning.

Expound it of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light, and the reaſon is euident.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21009:108"/> light of men, not of Angels, nor any other creatures, who haue no need, or no part of the ſpirituall life, and light, which is by, and in him. Looke not, that I ſhould magnifie the mercy of God toward mankind, in this reſpect; or ſo much as put you in minde, how infinitely wee are all beholding to his Maieſtie, for ſo vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and vndeſerued a fauour. Of that in due place: as yet wee haue but ſearched out the true ſenſe of the words.</p>
            <p>From which, I paſſe now to deliuer the Euangeliſts meaning, conteined in them. <hi>And that life was the light of men.</hi> What is it, that the holy Ghoſt would teach vs, by this kinde of ſpeech? Doubtleſs, either hee ſets out the benefits, wee reape by our Sauiour, in an other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; or els he intends to ſhew vs, how we come to the obteyning of them. I will ſpeake ſhortly of both. Life is the chiefeſt of all outward bleſſings; as vpon which all the reſt ſo farre depend, that without it, they ceaſe to bee, What doth any man injoy in this world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteining to his beeing, or well beeing here, which receiues not end with this preſent life? Health, wealth, friends, beauty, wiſdome, learning, valour, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer els belongeth to the comfort, or ornament of man, in this world, is bounded on euery ſide with the limits of this naturall life. Therefore is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of not killing ſet in the firſt place, of all matters that concerne ordinarie men; becauſe hee, that taketh away life, ſpoiles a man at one ſtroke, of all things appeartaining to this preſent world. Yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man enjoyeth life, who hath little ioy of any thing in life; and to ſpeake according to the point in hand, who lackes a chiefe comfort of life, the ſight either of bodie, or of minde, or of both. Therefore although the Euangeliſt had told vs before, that life was in CHRIST, then which nothing is more excellent: yet hee truely conceiued, that a farther benefit might
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21009:109"/> be added, namely light. So doth our Sauiour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeake of himſelfe, heaping vp as it were one bounty vpon an other, and ſetting forth in diuers ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, the blesſings wee receiue by beleefe in him. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> And in one place, to ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <note place="margin">Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But it is a bleſſing aboue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of man, to haue ſuch a light held out vnto him, as ſhall direct him to euerlaſting life: that ſhall not onely make him able to ſee the way, that lies before him, but ſhall goe before him as a guide in the way, to the end of ſo happie a iourney. This is that then, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> inſtructeth vs in, that our Sauiour Chriſt is not onely the fountaine of life, which ſtreameth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſueth forth to all them, that by faith cleaue vnto him; but that hee is alſo the light, that leades, and vſners vs as it were, into the palace of heauen. Thou liueſt in him, and by him: Thou haſt thy vnderſtanding inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the true knowledge of God, and cleere ſight of the certaine way to ſaluation. I can hardly ſtay my ſelfe from falling into ſome earneſt exhortation, when I conſider theſe wonderous blesſings, that are to bee had in Chriſt. But I muſt of necesſitie forbeare it, till I haue ended the expoſition.</p>
            <p>Which may reaſonably bee thus deliuered; that the Euangeliſt, in theſe words, giues vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the life, which hee ſaid was in CHRIST, is conueyed to men, by a certaine inlightning of them, with the ſauing knowledge of GOD in CHRIST. As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>Whereas all men naturally are dead in ſinne, and by reaſon of ſinne, liable to eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21009:109"/> and alſo are farder ouerwhelmed with the miſt of ignorance in darkneſſe, that they cannot diſcerne of the way, that leads to true happineſs; He that firſt created the world, and all therein of nothing, hath taken a ſecond paines to reuiue them, that are voide of life, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them, which are couered with darkneſſe; that as hee hath prouided meanes of life for them: ſo they may ſee, what thoſe meanes are, and ſeeing attaine vnto them.</hi> So that whatſoeuer may bee needefull to the obtaining of euerlaſting life; all that, our Sauiour hath gratiouſly, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d bountifully prouided. Art thou dead? In him is life. Art thou ignorant that thou canſt not deſcerne of the way to life? That life, which is in him, is the light of men. If hee had not brought the former, it would neuer haue come. If he had brought it, and not ſeconded that faucur with a farder kindnes, to make vs ſee our owne death, and life in him, all had bin to no purpoſe. For who will ſeeke for that, whereof (in his owne conceit) he hath no neede, not vſe? who will ſpend his time about the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that, which he hath no po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore although the maine blesſing, &amp; end of all, be life in Chr. yet the diſcouering of this life is ſo neceſſary that without it we ſhould be neuer a whit the better for the other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are for thoſe riches, &amp; treſurs, which are hid in the fardeſt parts of the world, vnſeen, &amp; vnknown to vs.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that our Euangeliſt addes <hi>light to life;</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of his Lord, and maiſter, who makes ſo often, and ſo honorable mention of the <hi>light. This is</hi>

Now, that wee may not bee guiltie of the ſame ſinne, and fall into the ſame damnation; Let vs ſtirre vp our dead hearts, by the conſideration of the doctrine herein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That life was the light of men:</hi> that is, according to the former expoſition; <hi>The ſame worde or Mesſiah, that is the autor of life, is alſo the fountaine of light vnto vs.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, what are wee but dead carkaſſes? without light, what are we but blind beetles? Light without life can no more quicken vs, then the fiſh in the ſea, or the beaſts in the forreſt nouriſh vs. Life without light can no more guide vs to happineſs, then a good appetite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meate feede vs. If either faile, neither auailes. But if <hi>that life be the light of men;</hi> both the end and the way are ready for vs, and open to vs. Refine thy thoughts, to meditate on ſo high a fauour. Inlarge thy heart, to conceiue ſo great a kindneſs. Was it not enough for IESVS CHRIST to bring life into the world, but that hee muſt alſo light vs the way to finde it? Had it not bin more then extraordinary loue, to lay
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21009:110"/> it before vs, though hee had not as it were thruſt, and forced it vpon vs? Muſt hee giue thee both meate to feede thee, and ſtomack to eat it? O incredible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour! O more then admirable kindneſs! Hee offers thee life. Thou neither regardeſt it, nor ſeeſt it. I would we did not turne away our faces from it. He opens thine eyes, and makes thee ſee it. Wilt thou ſhut them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and bee wilfully blind? S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The darknes is great, and thick; but the light doth pearce, and ſcatter it. There is nothing wanting but a willingnes to ſee. What if it were farre off, that it could hardly bee diſcerned? Couldeſt thou reaſonably excuſe thy ſelfe, by a feare of ouer-ſtrayning thy ſight? It is life thou lookeſt at. If thou ſhouldeſt breake thine eye-ſtrings with thy earneſtneſs in looking, would any man ſay, it was not worth the venturing? It is better to goe blind into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then hauing full ſight of both eyes to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell fire. I was purpoſed to haue ſpent this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in kindling, or inflaming our affection if I could, with the loue of him, that hath ſo carefully, gratiouſly, and bountifully prouided for vs: and muſt I bee faine to beſtow my time, and paines in perſwading you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſo rare a courteſie? But what ſay I curteſie? Kindnes, fauour, loue, the moſt affectionate, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible words, that can be deuiſed, are too cold, and weake, to ſignifie, I will not ſay to expreſſe ſuch vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bounty.</p>
            <p>But let vs make as light reckoning as poſſibly we can, of being inlightened. Let vs account it a ſmall fauour to ſee, that wee are guided in the way to happineſs. Let vs deſpiſe the pleaſure we may take, by knowing what wee haue eſcap't, and what wee ſhall come too. At the leaſt, though we care not to know our happineſs,

Shall thy profit carry thee away, that thou wilt not ſee? I were as good hold my peace, as ſpeake, and not bee heard.

Thou canſt not doe a ſouldiour a greater pleaſure, then to put him into ſome diſcourſe of warre. How gladly doth a Mariner take occaſion to intreat of nauigation? So all profeſſions, and trades, eaſily fall into ſpeech of that, wherein they haue beſt knowledge. Onely in the profeſſion of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the caſe is otherwiſe. You ſhall finde many a one, (I would I might not truely ſay very many, I am ſure I may ſay ouer many) that can not indure to ſpeake themſelues, or heare other men enter into any diſcourſe of life in CHRIST. Tell me I pray you, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why other ſorts of profeſſions are ſo forward in talking of their artes, and trades? Is it not becauſe they make account they haue ſome good skill in them? Could Chriſtians be ſo backward to reaſon of matters touching their ſaluation, but that they are priuie to their owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in ſuch caſes? Shall a ſmith, or a ſhoomaker, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſpeake of his craft, becauſe he is skilfull in it? and ſhal we hold off, and ſhunne ſpeech of our glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, becauſe; but I will ſay no more for very ſhame of the world. It were not posſible we ſhould auoide ſuch communication, if we knewe how to carry our ſelues in it, without bewraying our ignorance.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:21009:112"/> How then ſtands the caſe with vs? Are wee not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened? Then are we not quickened. If wee bee in darkeneſſe, we are in death too. This, this (it is be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) is the caſe of many of vs. There is no life in vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in vs: With this light wee may ſearch our hearts, and diſcerne, whether we be indeede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, or dead, What know I, concerning mine owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall eſtate? What haue I learned of my firſt tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Adam?</hi> What feeling am I come to of the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble corruption, where with my ſoule, and body are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? What vnderſtand I of Ieſus Chriſts natures, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices? Haue I conſidered the infiniteneſs of the loue of God, in ſending his owne, and onely ſonne to be my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? Am I well inſtructed in the doctrine of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings? Is the value of his inualuable ſacrifice magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, though not comprehended? Let me yet come a little neerer. How many are there that do not ſo much, as know what Ieſus Chriſt was? what it is to bee iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; what it is to beleeue? We are buried in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of death; hauing nothing in vs, but the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of life. I appeale to thine owne ſoule, whoſoeuer thou art, that wouldeſt be ſaued: I deſire thee not to let mee ſee the light, that is in thee, but to looke into thine owne heart, whether therebe any there, or no. The triall is betwixt God, and thee. It is in vaine to ſay, thou art inlightened. For he knows, what is in thee, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thou dooſt thy ſelfe. And there is no greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of thy blindneſſe, then that thou dooſt not ſee it. He, that begins to ſee, perceiues hee wants a great deale of ſeeing perfectly. But he, that was borne blind, and continues ſo, knows not that there is any ſuch thing as ſight to bee had, but onely as hee heares other men talke of it: Such is the eſtate of many profeſſed Chriſtians. They haue heard I know not what ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Adam, and his fall; of CHRIST, and his death, and ſuch other matters: But they know no
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:21009:113"/> one point, or other, ſoundly; and throughly, either to their humiliation, or conſolation.</p>
            <p>And yet (for I muſt repeate it againe, and often) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, there is no life, to be had in Ieſus Chriſt. How long, then will you wander in darkneſſe? When will you approche to life? Let it ſuffice vs, that we haue hitherto continued in ignorance: yet the light ſhines vnto vs. Who can tell how ſoone the Lord will bee weary of waiting on vs, and holding out the light of ſaluation to them, that will not ſee? Deceiue not your owne ſelues with a vaine hope of life, as if it could be ſeized on, by groping in the darke. Be not wanting to your ſelues, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly yee ſhall be ſaued. Chriſt Ieſus hath prouided life ſor you. The ſame Chriſt Ieſus is ready to ſhew you the way to it; nay, hath ſhewed it to you already, if you would haue vouchſaf't to looke toward it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are not blind onely, but dead alſo, he hath ſent vs his ſeruants, and miniſters, to call vpon you, to cry out vnto you, to intreat you, that you would open your eies, and ſee the light. It lies ſhining vpon your eie-liddes; do but lift them vp, and it will enter. What ſhall you loſe by receiuing ſight? What will it hurt you to be ſaued? Is any man ſo hardly intreated to his owne good? You ſhall not trauaile alone, in the way to life. Behold heere is company on euery ſide. I, and my brethren the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will carry the light before you; do but follow it, and the light will bring you to life. If any man, for all this, will rouſt in darkneſſe; though hee refuſe to ſee the light, yet ſhall that diſcouer him both to God and men. Art thou not aſhamed to know, that ſo many ſee thy blindneſſe? Art thou not affraid, that the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will caſt thee into eternall darkneſſe, ſince thou takeſt no pleaſure in light? Rowſe vp thy ſelfe, and ſhake off this drowſineſſe, that CHRIST IESVS may giue thee light. If thou wilt not, neuer preſſe into this, and the like places. God is not deceiued. Thou
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21009:113"/> makeſt a ſhew of loue to the light, when thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt hither, where it ſhines. Is thy ſight dim? The light will cleere it. Haſt thou no ſight at all? The light will giue thee eies to ſee withall. The light of the ſunne appeares not, but where there are eies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, and thoſe open too. But the light of life which is in CHRIST, makes eies where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and cauſeth life in all, that are willing to haue it.</p>
            <p>Whereof if any man doubt, let our Euangeliſt reſolue him: who, proceeding to ſhew vs the effect of the light, tells vs, that <hi>it ſhines in darkneſſe;</hi> as it were offring it ſelfe to diſperſe, and ſcatter whatſoeuer hindereth or ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our full inlightning. For though it follow in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verſe, <hi>that the darkneſſe comprehends it not:</hi> Yet the force of the light appeares in ſome, who by it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to knowledge, and ſaluation. But this belongs to an other place and diſcourſe: let vs go forward in our expoſition. Wherein we are firſt to conſider the words, then to deliuer the ſenſe. The words are not ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in themſelues as the varietie of interpretations hath made them: which indeede is ſo great, that if I ſhould handle them at large, both you and I ſhould be ſooner wearied, then edified. I will therefore content my ſelfe with ſome little ſpeech concerning the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the expoſitions. And therein firſt wee muſt ſee what light it is, the Euangeliſt ſpeakes of: then what hee ſaies of it; that it <hi>ſhineth in darknes.</hi> By light, generallie CHRIST, or his doctrine, or both, are thought to bee ſignified. The variety of opinions principallie conſiſts in the diuers reſpects in which hee may bee conceiued to bee ſpoken of. All which may bee referred to theſe two heads; his diuine Nature, or his Perſon. And ſo much of theſe reſpects in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: the particulars I muſt needs reſerue, till I haue ſhewed what is meant by <hi>darknes,</hi> and <hi>not comprehending;</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:21009:114"/> for without the knowledge of them, this cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. In the meane while. wee may eaſily gheſſe at the Euangeliſts meaning if wee aſſure our ſelues, as there is good cauſe wee ſhould, that <hi>the light</hi> here is all one, with that in the former verſe. Whereof who can reaſonably make any doubt? Hath not the Euangeliſt held the ſame courſe before? <hi>One and the ſame worde was in the beginning, was God, was with God.

For it will appeare anone, that <hi>by not comprehending,</hi> not acknowledging, or not receiuing the light, is ſignified. But although the darknes bee not cleered and made bright by the light; yet the light it ſelf ſhineth; that is, caſteth, and ſpreadeth abroad his beams. Doth not the Sun ſhine, but when it is ſeene?

What is this to the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall light, which comes from our Sauiour, by his word and doctrine? may ſome men ſay, I will tell thee. The holy Ghoſt will haue vs by this former part of the ſimilitude, to gather, and vnderſtand the later, in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort. The life that is in Chriſt (ſayth Saint <hi>Iohn)</hi> is that, which inlightens men; giuing them, or at the leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording, &amp; offring them the knowledge of their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and deadnes, and of light, and life to bee had by, &amp; in Chriſt. Now it is well knowne, that the light, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature thereof, ſhines in darkenes; ſo did, doth, and will, this ſupernaturall light, alwayes ſhewe it ſelfe to them, that looke after it.</p>
            <p>This (I take it) is that, which our Euangeliſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendes, and implyes, though hee expreſſe it not. Since wee perceiue, that the light muſt needes ſhine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the life in Chriſt is the light of men; how canne wee chooſe but conclude, that certainely the light did ſhine, while our Sauiour was in the world?</p>
            <p>So then, the light ſhineth alwayes by nature; But where ſhineth it? Surely in darkenes. For there is no vſe of light, but in reſpect of darkeneſſe: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer any light ſhines, there is darkneſſe, without that light, naturally, and ordinarily. What darkneſſe is it, wherein this ſupernaturall light ſhineth? Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, a darkneſſe ſutable to that light. For the Sunne in his greateſt brightnes, at high noone in ſummer, ſhines not to the ſoule, but to the body of man; &amp; the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt knowledge, &amp; cleereſt light of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, helps nothing to the inlightning of our bodily darknes: but the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt idiot, if his ſight be good, wil ſee as wel, as the wiſeſt man in the world, if he haue the ſun light. This then muſt be layd, as the foundation of the building; that <hi>by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> not the abſence of naturall light, but the want of ſpirituall knowledge is ſignified. And as by light wee
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21009:116"/> vnderſtand the perſon of the Meſſiah, together with the doctrine hee taught, concerning our ſpirituall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; ſo by darkeneſſe wee muſt in like ſort conceiue the ignorance of him, and of that knowledge, which hee imparted to the world, whereby onely euerlaſting life can bee attained to. What then is this darkeneſſe, wherein the light ſhineth? what elſe, but the blindneſs of men, by which they are vnable to ſee, and knowe, what belongs to their eternall ſaluation; the infidelity of men, whereby they are hindred, and withheld from acknowledging the meanes of it, when they are offred?</p>
            <p>Of the doctrine anone; as yet I am in ſearch for the meaning of the word. Which, as all men know, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, ſignifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For this place, wee muſt needes take it generally, as wee did light, and ſo apply it to the particular in hand. The light naturally ſhines in darkenes; and bodily light in bodily darkeneſſe, the ſpirituall in ſpirituall. So did the Meſſiah ſhine in the ignorance, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men. So did the doctrine of ſaluation ſhew
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21009:117"/> it ſelfe, in the blindneſſe, and naughtineſſe of the world. The former point of the natural, &amp; bodily light ſhining in darkenes, is not any matter of diuinity; &amp; beſides ſo well knowne to children, that it were loſt labour to ſay any thing of it. Let vs keepe our ſelues to the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts meaning; and after wee haue a little proued the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, conſider the matter for our farther inſtruction, and edification.

            <p>What ſhall we ſay to theſe men; and how ſhall wee aunſwere them? if wee deny them to bee learned, all the world will condemne vs of ignorance, or enuy? Shal we grant, that they ſhine with learning, &amp; yet accuſe them, as hidden in darkneſſe? What is light, but knowledge? What is darkneſſe, but ignorance? Either they are in darkneſſe, becauſe they want knowledge; or if they haue knowledge, they are not in darknes. How ſtands the caſe then? Haue we accuſd them vniuſtly? That were to condemne the holy Ghoſt of falſhood; as if hee had made them worſe then they are, that he might magnify our Sauiour Chriſt the more.

For what are they but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that knowe not the true God; nor how he is to bee worſhipt? What light is there in them, that ſee not the way to their owne happineſs, nor vnderſtand where it is to be had? I ſhould neuer done, if I ſhould, let me not ſay refute, but recite their manifold errors, touching God himſelfe, the foundation of all religion. Giue mee leaue therefore I pray you to omit them all, ſaue a very few of the moſt principall. Firſt, whereas there is but one God, as the very light of Nature ſheweth, they ſet vp, in their blind fancies, infinit multitudes of Gods, &amp; Goddeſſes, to the number of I wot not how many (I am ſure a greate many) thouſands; that, as the Prophet ſaith of the Iewes, <hi>according to the number of their Cytties</hi> (yea <note place="margin">Ier. 2. 28.</note> and far aboue it too) <hi>ſo were their Gods.</hi> Yet had this bin the more tolerable (though indeed it were moſt intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) if they had not added a ſecond errour, worſe, if worſe may be, then the firſt. Bee it, that they could not content themſelues with one God, but muſt needs haue heapes of them for fayling; was it poſſible, they could be ſo abſurde, and ſenſleſſe, as not to deuiſe them all of one kinde, and nature? Say there was ſome colour, for to imagin there ſhould bee a difference of ſexe, and ſo hee Gods, and ſhee Gods: yet was there not any the leaſt ſhewe of reaſon to conceiue, they might bee of diuerſe natures. There is wonderfull variety of nations, &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world: yet all are of one kind; of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of body, of the ſame nature of the ſoul. But the Gods of the heathen, many of them (can they heare it without bluſhing?) are vtterly of a diuerſe kind one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another. Some of them were Gods both by the Father, amd Mother, ſome only by the Fathers ſide, ſome by the mothers, ſide only, ſome by neither. What ſay you to the Sunne the Moone, &amp; diuerſe ſtarrs? Could theſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21009:121"/> be of the ſame kind with the former? Certainely beaſts, foules, fiſhes, creeping things, onions, garlicke, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to ſay all I could, were Gods of an other nature then thoſe before mentioned. Do you think theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that made themſelues ſuch Gods, had any ſpark of light in them? Is it not pitty, but theſe companions ſhoulde be held to be wiſe, &amp; learned? What dreames of a ſick mans diſtempered braine, what old wiues fable, what idle fancy of a child, that builds Caſtles in the aire, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo abſurde, or ſo impious? And ſuch as their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were of their Gods, ſuch was their worſhip; By murders, adulteries, inceſts, filthy ſpeeches, abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble geſtures, ſorceries, coniurations. The leaſt ſinne of this kinde, was their doating Idolatry; that hee, which only made an idoll of God, and did him no farder diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, might well be counted a holy man, amongſt a route of ſuch prophane miſcreants.</p>
            <p>Could theſe men (let them boaſt of their knowledge as much as they liſt) could theſe men, I ſay, know wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their owne happineſſe conſiſted, or how they might attaine vnto it? How ſhould he, that is ignorant of God from whom all things receiue as their being, ſo their well being, euer vnderſtand what felicity is, or how it may be come by? There needes no other, nor can bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better proofe of their ignorance, in this point, then the multitude of diuerſe and many contrary opinions. One of the heathen a learned <hi>Roman</hi> hath left vs record <note place="margin">Varro, apud Aug. de cruitder.</note> of almoſt 300. ſeueral conceits touching the ſoueraingne good, or felicity of man. It were a hard matter for a man to chuſe among ſo many, eſpecially where hee hath no certaine marks, whereby to direct him in his choiſe. But what a miſery is it, for one to vex, and tire himſelfe in ſeeking, when the thing, he ſeekes for, is not neere the place of his ſearch?

Well: let vs take pitty of their ignorance, &amp; ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that true happineſſe is only in the inioying of God. What are they the neerer?

For ſince the vnderſtanding is the moſt principall part of the ſoule; how can it bee, but a man muſt principally delight in that, which is the cheefeſt perfection therof? What ſhould then, in reaſon, bee of greater force, to make vs ſtrike the ſaile of pride, then the conſideration of our ignorance. Euery one of vs is ready to ſay to himſelfe; Haue not I ſharpneſſe of witte; ſoundneſſe of iudgement; a quick conceit, to apprehend what I heare; a deepe reach to compaſſe what I diſire?

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21009:123"/> O the ignorance, and blindneſſe of men! Let vs bee as wiſe, and skilfull in worldly matters, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ourſelues to be: in true wiſedom, and knowledge, we are fooles, and blind. Darkneſſe, palpable darknes, nothing but darkneſſe. I make challenge here to all the learned of the world, that euer were, are, or ſhall bee, to ſhew their skil, and learning, either in deuiſing a means to bring a diſtreſſed ſoule to quietneſſe, and comfort, or in diſprouing the meanes diſcouered by the Goſpel, or in prouing the truth of it, as it is reuealed. If they can doe none of all theſe, let them confeſſe, as they muſt needes, that they are indeed blind, and ignorant.</p>
            <p>This being confeſt, as it cannot be denied; let vs ſee now, what meanes they are are able to procure of inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and inſtruction. Nature affords them none; for if it did, ſome man, or other, in all this time, would haue hit vpon it. Will learning helpe them? It is not poſſible it ſhould. For what is learning, but the perfection of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If the foundation bee weake, the building muſt needes bee ruinous. The light of nature may ſhew thee many defects, and faults, many vices, and vnruly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the knowledge of Philoſophy may confirme this Iudgement of nature, and adde much to the heape, that thou maiſt be ouerwhelmed with the conſideration of thy wickedneſſe, and wretchedneſſe. But neither can both theſe, by any ſtudy, and meditation, fully informe thee of thy miſerable, and damnable eſtate: and when they haue done all, they poſſibly can, they wil either leaue thee deſperate, to conſume thy ſelfe with ſorrow, or bring thee into a fooles paradiſe, and lead thee gaily to deſtruction, as an Oxe with guilded hornes, &amp; ſweet Garlands, to be ſlaughtered in ſacrifice. How then ſhal we get out of this darkneſſe? Who wil ſhew vs the way to knowledge? O that there were this hart in vs indeed! O that wee were as truly deſirous to find the right way, as we are aſham'd to be thought ignorant of it! How

Neither can our owne miſery driue vs, nor his kindneſſe allure vs to him. O that wee woulde but a little conſider, how extraodinarily we are beholding to this light, <hi>that ſhines in darknes!</hi> Let vs take ſome view of it, in a like matter. Imagine that thou wert wandring, thou knowſt not whither, all alone, naked, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, the darkneſſe being ſo great, that thou couldſt not ſee thy hand, the winde blowing through thee, the raine powring downe vpon thee, the colde ſtriking to thy very heart, the way ſo ſlippery, that thou couldſt not ſtande vpright, ſo full of deepe holes, that euery ſtep, thou ſhouldſt bee in daunger of breaking thy leggs, or armes: at the end of thy trauaile, when thou ſhouldſt come to reſt, ſuppoſe there were al kinde of torments, and tortures prepared for thee, which thou couldſt by no meanes eſcape: tel mee now, canſt thou poſſibly conceiue, how infinitly thou ſhouldſt be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to him that ſhould bring thee a light, ſhewe thee the perils of thy iourney, the certaine deſtruction in the end thereof; that ſhould ſet thee in a plaine &amp; eaſy path, ſhould cloth thee, comfort thee, keep thee company, &amp; bring thee to a place, or palace rather of al pleaſure, and happines?

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21009:125"/> diſtinction of the perſons, but only the being, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and wiſedome of the diuine nature; and if it could, yet might wee bee in darkeneſſe, concerning ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for all that knowledge. It remaines then, that wee take the worde in the ordinary ſignification thereof; and accordingly vnderſtand the Euangeliſt, as if hee had ſaid in plaine tearmes, that <hi>our Sauiour Chriſt, by the doctrine of the Goſpell, which hee preached, and by the miracles, which hee daiely wrought, ſhewed himſelfe to bee the light of the world, and the true meanes of ſaluation; but men being blind in their iudgement, and peruerſe in their affections, would not acknowledge him for their Sauiour, that they might come to life by him.</hi> And for the meaning of the worde, let that, which hath bin ſaid, ſuffice.</p>
            <p>If any man be deſirous to knowe the reaſon, why the holy Ghoſt changeth his maner of ſpeech, and whereas in the next words hee had ſayd <hi>Shineth,</hi> and not <hi>Shined,</hi> he now ſaith <hi>Comprehended,</hi> and not <hi>Comprehendeth:</hi> hee muſt remember, that in the former clauſe, as wee heard, the generall nature of the light is expreſt, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſhineing of this ſupernaturall light implied therein. After this manner; the Euangeliſt hauing told vs, that our Sauiour was the light of men, proceeds to ſhewe what hee did for the inlighting of them, &amp; what they refuſed to doe, that they might bee inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: as if hee ſhould haue ſaid; The light naturally ſhineth in darkneſſe, and ſo did that light I ſpeake o', but the darkeneſſe woulde not receiue it, to bee inlightned.

            <p>There are 2 things, that diſcouer the blindneſſe and folly of mankind vnto vs. The former, that hauing ſo great a conceit of our naturall parts, and ſuch eſpeciall helpes of education, and inſtruction, wee ſhoulde not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be vnable to deuiſe, &amp; determin, how we might attaine to the cheefe point of happineſſe, that we are capable of: the later, and more ſhamefull of the 2 is this, that we are ſo full of darkeneſſe, and peruerſeneſſe, that we neither will, nor can learne, what belongs to our felicity, when it is kindely, and plainely taught vs. The <note place="margin">leſiod. &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

If there were any man, that came ſhort of this later, him they wholly condemn'd of extreame folly. And can we thinke our ſelues wife, yea bragge of our learning, and knowledge, when wee are not able to ſet one foote vpon this firſt, &amp; loweſt ſtep to wiſdome? Doe we thinke much to be charg'd ſo deepely with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance?

Hee findes not fault with the ſloweneſſe of thy imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thou canſt not of thy ſelfe, by naturall witte, or learning finde out, what is true happineſſe, and how to attaine vnto it. but he ſhewes thy dulneſſe, &amp; blindneſs, that thou knoweſt it not, when it is lay'd before thee. I would it were not worſe then ſo. Yes yes: it is a degree lower. Thou canſt neither direct thy ſelfe in the way of life, nor if thou be ſet in it, perceiue when thou art right, nor by any rea on bee perſwaded to acknowledge it, though a man ſhould ſhew thee, which it is.</p>

            <p>Nay (ſayth ſome man) you ſhall neuer make mee haue ſo all an opinion of my ſelfe. Perhaps indeede, I ſhould hardly hit on that waie, without a guide; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue not gone it at any time heeretofore: and therefore I grant alſo, that it is poſſible I ſhould not knowe it, when I were in it; but I would not haue you thinke me ſo vnreaſonable, that I ſhould refuſe to learn that, whereof I am ignorant. Wel ſayd: I perceiue thou haſt a good conceit of thy ſelfe: and I will not preſſe thee too far in thine owne particular; but rather ſhewe thee thy caſe in an other mans example. And that I may not ſeeme to diſparage thee in thy wit, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by any baſe compariſon, let me offer to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the whole people of the Iewes; not as they are now in the ſtate of bondage and miſerie, but as they were in that time, when the light we ſpeake of ſhone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. I will not ſtand to magnifie their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts of nature, and learning: I will ſay nothing of their Scribes and Phariſies; I will not mention their Prieſts, and Leuites: what they were for their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and vnderſtanding, the learned know, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned may gheſſe by the report of them, that haue trade and trafficke with them daily, euen now when their wits are dulled, and their hearts as it were broken, with the continuall ſenſe of their bondage, and miſery Surely there is no great reaſon, why any man ſhoulde thinke ſo highly of himſelfe, or ſo meanely of them, as to preſume of his owne skill, where their iudgement hath fayled them. Eſpecially in a matter of this nature, concerning God, and euerlaſting life; wherein they were extraodinarily inſtructed by him, that only could teach them. Match thy ſelfe with them for ſufficiencie of naturall gifts, equall them in helps of learning: yet certainly thou muſt needes come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Where hauing, in the fiue former verſes, deſcribed the Meſſiah, of whom hee writes, by his diuine nature, and his office of mediation, hee proceeds to ſecond that, hee hath deliuered, with the teſtimonie of <hi>Iohn;</hi> and there vpon takes occaſion to inlarge ſome of the points, that before hee had propounded, and to ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the benifits wee receiue by our Sauiour, more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and plainely. In the former part, concerning the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21009:129"/> witneſſe of <hi>Iohn,</hi> firſt wee are to conſider the partie as hee is deſcribed to vs in the three verſes, I read. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to waigh his teſtimony; which is implyed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then expreſt in the two later: <hi>Hee came to beare witneſſe of the light.</hi> The deſcription is partly of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, verſe 6, &amp; partly of his office, ver. 7. 8. To the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his perſon there belong theſe two thinges; his nature, and his name. By nature hee was a man; but yet not after the ordinarie courſe of mankinde, but after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſort, by a ſpecial work of God, who ſent him as well in reguard of his perſon, as of his office. Which office of his is firſt plainely declared, verſe 7, then ſome what amplified, verſe 7. 8. The declaration is general: <hi>He came for a witneſſe.</hi> Particular: <hi>To beare witneſſe of the light.</hi> In the deſcription of the perſon; touching his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I note two points; that <hi>He was a man;</hi> that <hi>He was ſent from God.</hi> In the former, wee are to examine the wordes, whether the former of the two <hi>was,</hi> imply any eſpecial matter or no, why the Euangeliſt mentions, that <hi>He was a man.</hi> Then muſt wee ſay ſomewhat of the ſenſe intended by Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> For the later point, of his being ſent, we will in quire, who ſent him; <hi>God;</hi> the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſome one of the perſons. How he was ſent: by an extraordinarie conception; by an eſpeciall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either by ſome viſion, or by reuelation. Touching his name, wee are to learne, what the ſignification of it is, why the Euangeliſt doth mention it.</p>
            <p>Other reaſons, whereby wee proue any matter in queſtion, haue their force, and power to argue, ſuch as it is, more or leſſe, from their owne nature; onely a Teſtimonie fetcheth all the waight it hath, from the credite, or authoritie of him, that giues it. So that where as in ordinarie proofes wee regard what is ſayde, rather then who ſayth it; in this witneſſe bearing, the man is firſt reſpected, and then the matter.

The diuerſitie in that place was to bee drawn from the tenſe, or time of the Verb, wheras in the originall Greek there is no ſuch varietie; and in the Latine, vpon which many ground, no certainty for the proofe of ſuch a difference, either in the nature, or vſe of the two wordes, as I then ſhewed more at large.

So that the beginning muſt belong not to his <hi>being</hi> abſolutely, but his <hi>being ſent.</hi> So ſaith

            </p>
            <p>I am not afrayd therefore of being accuſed, to haue omitted ſomething, which the holy Ghoſt intended to teach vs, though I ſay nothing of that difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt, and <hi>Iohn</hi> concerning the eternall being of the one, and the others beginning to bee in time. Neither doe I ſee any neceſsitie the of expounding the worde, as ſome other men take it, to note the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie conception, and eduction of the Baptiſt; which either are not toucht by our Euangeliſt: or if they bee, are to be deliuered in that point, of his ſending. As for the word <hi>was,</hi> I hope I haue made it plaine, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to his being ſent, and hath no eſpeciall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The like (in my poore opinion) may truely be ſayd of the other word <hi>Man,</hi> that it is indefinitly taken for <hi>One,</hi> as wee commonly ſpeak in English: <hi>There was one ſent.</hi> Of the likelihood of this interpretation, <hi>by and by,</hi> it firſt you will giue mee leaue, to ſpeake a word or two of that, which is generally conceiued by it. Which is, that by <hi>Man,</hi> the nature of <hi>Iohn</hi> is ſignified. To what ende? partly that the former difference, betwixt Chriſt, and him, might bee more expreſt: partly that no man might take him for an Angell, though he be ſo called by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy.</hi> But neither of these (ſauing their better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are of a contrary opinion) ſeemes to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſufficient reaſon of ſuch an expoſition. Firſt the difference they ayme at, is as plaine, and as great, as may be. <hi>The one was in the beginning, was with God, was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 1. 2. Ver. 6. Ver. 4. 5. Ver. 8.</note> 
               <hi>God. The other was ſent by God,</hi> and no farther matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucht of him. The one <hi>had life in him, and was the light of men. The other was not the light, but came to beare witnes of the light</hi> Secondly, the auouching of him to bee a man, doth not expreſſe that difference. For our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:21009:130"/> was alſo a man, as truely, and naturally as he. <hi>The worde became fleſh. As by a man came death, ſo by a man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 14. 1. Cor. 15. 20.</note> 
               <hi>came the reſurrection from the dead;</hi> yea hee is called <hi>the man, whom God appointed to iudge the world by.</hi> If <note place="margin">Act. 17. 31.</note> you ſay Chriſt is not onely a man: neither doth the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt a affirme any ſuch thing of <hi>Iohn,</hi> by that word; <hi>There was a man.</hi> Thirdly, who tooke <hi>Iohn,</hi> to be any other, then a man? The Iewes indeed (many of them) helde him for a Prophet; but none of them euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 21.</note> him to bee a man. Therefore alſo the ſecond reſpect, in which hee is called a man, is not much to <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 26.</note> bee reſpected. The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> (you ſay) calls <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> him an Angell. <hi>Behold I ſend mine Angell before thy face.</hi> What of that? Was it therefore to bee feared, that ſome men woulde thinke him to bee an Angell by nature? Neither doth <hi>Malachy</hi> ſo ſay; but rather ſhewes, that hee ſpeakes of his office, becauſe hee giues the ſame title to the Meſſiah, though with an additon, <hi>The Angell of the Couenant:</hi> and who but thoſe, that beleeued the Goſpell, acknowledged <hi>Iohn</hi> to bee he of whome that was written by the Prophet; Beſides, his parents and kindred were well knowne, and his birth was extraordinarily famous; yea the whole courſe of his life, his preaching, and his death, were matters common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talkt of among the Iewes.</p>
            <p>There was little reaſon then, why the Euangeliſt ſhould giue any eſpeciall notice of his nature, in eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The later, <hi>Sent from God,</hi> offer theſe two things to our conſideration; who ſent: what this ſending was. What needs any queſtion of the former? may ſome man ſay. Doth not the Euangeliſt ſpeake plaine enough, and tell vs, that <hi>God,</hi> was the ſender? <hi>Hee was ſent from God.</hi> But we learned in the beginning of this Goſpell, that the worde <hi>God,</hi> ſomtimes ſignified the diuine nature, which is but one and the ſame in all three, perſons, ſometimes ſome one of them. And we haue here the more reaſon to make this inquirie, becauſe one of the perſons, namely the ſecond, is he, of whome <hi>Iohn</hi> was to witnes. Not to vſe more words then neede, wee are directed by <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe to vnderſtand this of <hi>GOD</hi> the Father. This I prooue by this our Euangeliſt, in this preſent chapter; where he reports part of the Bapriſts teſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, touching our Sauiour, in this ſort; <hi>He that ſent mee to baptize with water, he ſaid vnto me, vpon whom thou</hi>

               <hi>ſhalt ſee the ſpirit come downe, and tarry ſtill on him, that is hee, which baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Who is this, that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21009:131"/> ſent <hi>Iohn</hi> to baptize? Not the diuine nature. For he is diſtinguiſht from the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt; who can it be then, but the Father? <hi>God</hi> the father gaue <hi>Iohn</hi> a token whereby he ſhould know the Sonne, that was the Meſſiah; the comming downe of the holy Ghoſt, and his abiding on him. S. <hi>Mathew</hi> ſets out the point, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. The ſecond Perſon is in the water, newly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, the third ſits vpon him in the likenes of a Doue, the firſt proclaimes him from heauen. <hi>This is that my Sonne,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that beloued one, in whome I am well pleaſed.</hi> As if hee ſhould in plaine tearmes haue ſaid to <hi>Iohn.</hi> This is hee, of whome I ſent thee to beare witneſs. The like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, for the Father, and the Sonne, wee haue in Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> where <hi>Zachary</hi> the father of <hi>Iohn,</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying <note place="margin">Luke 1. 76.</note> of his ſonne, ſayeth, that <hi>hee ſhall be called the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the moſt high,</hi> namely of God the Father; as it appeares by the ſpeech of the Angell <hi>Gabriell</hi> to the virgin <hi>Mary: Hee ſhall be called the Sonne of the moſt</hi>

            <p>But how did God the Father ſend him? Surely hee may well bee ſaid to haue bin ſent, in regard both of his perſon, and of his office. His perſon (as it is wel knowne, I will but point at the particulars) was after an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie manner from GOD; as <hi>I ſaac</hi> was giuen to <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 10.</note>

This laſt ſending onely, is thought by ſome to bee ſignified in this place. If they had ſaid no more but <hi>chiefly,</hi> I ſhould enſily haue aſſented to them: Now they ſay <hi>onely,</hi> I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue any ſufficient warrant, ſo to reſtraine the holy Ghoſts words, or no; and therefore thinke it moſt conuenient, to allow them as large an extent, as they will reaſonably beare.</p>
            <p>You looke perhaps, that I ſhould now proceede to deliuer the Enangeliſts meaning, and accordingly to adde ſuch proofe. and exhortation, as may helpe vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the embracing of the Goſpell. But I thinke it fitteſt to forbeare that, for a time, till I haue expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the other part of the verſe. that I may take all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It followeth then to ſpeake of the name, and why the Euangelſt records it. The name as it ſoundeth in our language, hath little reſemblance of the originall, whence it commeth. Which if any man thinke a fault, let him take heede that he doe not raſhly condemne the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, who in the Greeke hath had ſmall care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Hebrew ſounds; following continually the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21009:132"/> cuſtome, howſoeuer not anſwering the originall tongue. Shall I need to bring any particulars for proofe of that I ſay? Looke ouer the new Teſtament, and whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you finde the name of any Prophet, where the Greeke differs from the Hebrew, you haue an example of that, which I affirme. Begin with <hi>Moſes</hi> if you will, and ſo goe forward to <hi>Malachy:</hi> You ſhall finde, that the holy Ghoſt keepes one, and the ſame courſe, in naming of them, without reſpect of their ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or ſounds. The reaſon of this is, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were wel known to the Iewes by thoſe names, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the 72. Interpreters had tranſlated them, after the manner of the Greeke tongue. Other languages <note place="margin">Except perhaps the Flem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſh.</note> by the ſame warrant, haue iuſtly taken the ſame liberty, and not doubted (as they needed not) to fit the He. brew, and Greeke names to the faſhion of their ſeuerall tongues: So that if any man ſhall either curiouſly affect, or ſuperſtitiouſly obſerue the nature, and ſound of thoſe names, which they haue in the originall, he ſhall not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therin the direction and practiſe of the holy Ghoſt, but his owne conceit, and perſwaſion. Doe I then ſay, it is vnlawfull to note the ſounds of ſuch names, that their interpretations may be knowne? Nothing leſſe. But as the Iewes, in the old Teſtament, haue ſome thouſands of <note place="margin">8000.</note> words, which they vſe for expounding the other in the text (whether by their own direction, or by the direction of the ſpirit of God, as ſome thinke, I will not diſpute) which yet they place in the margin of their bookes; So perhaps it were not vnfit to ſet theſe Hebrew and Greek names in the ſide, following in the ſcripture it ſelfe the ordinarie courſe, which the Lord vſeth, to frame the words, according to the nature of the tongue, in which he writes. How far then ought we al to be from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one another, either of ignorance, or careleſneſs, for not following the ſounds of the originall languages? But I will not preſſe this too much, till I haue ſome farder
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21009:133"/> occaſion giuen me, in the expounding of this Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Yet, howſoeuer I ſee no neceſſitie, nor conuenience for any ſuch ſtrictneſs in tranſlating proper names; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, that it is fit, and needfull to vnderſtand their ſignifications; eſpecially in ſuch of them, as were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely giuen by direction from God himſelfe, For they haue alwaies ſome inſtruction, ioined with them, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſomwhat that is paſt; as <hi>Iſack</hi> of <hi>ſarah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Of the later kinde is this name <hi>Iohn,</hi> whereby the Lord would haue his people the Iewes to know, and conſider, that hee would now <hi>viſit, and redeeme them,</hi> as <hi>Zacharie</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, at the circumciſing of him.

This vſe both the Iewes then, and wee now are to make of the name; not as if it had bin appointed vpon any humour, but as intending a help to that preparation, which was to follow.</p>
            <p>This was one reaſon, why it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, that our Euangeliſt ſhould ſet downe his name; that with the report of his being ſent from God, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his meſſage might, in a generall ſort, be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Eſpecially, if we remember withall, as we cannot almoſt chuſe but doe, that the name was enioined before his conception. by order from God himſelfe. Doth the Euangeliſt tell me, that his name was <hi>Iohn?</hi> Surely though he writ not the hiſtorie at large, yet he would haue mee conſider, that his name was of Gods appointing &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21009:133"/> of ſome extraodinarie ſignification, &amp; vſe; that wee may enter into ſuch a conſideration of him, as they did, that dwelling neer to his father, heard how matters had paſſed at his birth, concerning this name. <hi>They laid vp thoſe things in their hearts</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Luke) ſaying what</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 1. 66.</note> 
               <hi>manner of child ſhall this bee?</hi> If the like ſhould be done in this our time, it would fill all mens mouthes, and eares, though they found it did little, or nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne them. And ſhall we paſſe ouer, without due regard, a thing, that doth ſo much import vs? Will neither the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worde, ſo ſweet, and comfortable, delight vs? nor the manner of impoſing the name, ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and wonderfull, ſtirre vs vp to conſider it? nor the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of him, that appointed it, cauſe vs to aduiſe better of it? Let vs take heed, that this careleſnes be not a ſhreud ſigne, that we little eſteeme the grace it ſelfe, which the name ſhadoweth out vnto vs. The laſt reaſon why the name is mentioned, is the nature of the writing: which beeing an Hiſtorie, requireth that the names. at the leaſt of all principall men in it, ſhould bee recorded. This courſe our Euangeliſt heere followes, the rather, that all men may certainly know, whom hee meanes, this deſcription.</p>
            <p>What remaines, the words being expounded, but to deliuer the meaning of the Euangeliſt? which can not well be done, till wee vnderſtand, what his purpoſe is, in that hee ſayth. Now of that, there are diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all reaſonable, and of ſome likelihood. Wee may draw them to theſe heads; the courſe of the hiſtorie, and the amplifying of the matter, that concernes our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt. They that referre it to the courſe of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſay no more of it, but that the Euangeliſt, hauing ſpoken of our Sauiours diuine nature in the former <note place="margin">Chryſost. in Ioa. hom. 4.

Iudge then what reconing hee muſt bee of among the Iewes, that was of greater dignitie, and excellencie, then a man of ſuch eſtimation, as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt. Surely I can not eaſily diſcerne, what could be written more to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and honor of CHRIST, after the former points of his diuine nature, and mediatorſhip, then this compariſon, by which hee is magnified aboue <hi>Iohn</hi> And there fore wee may well allow this expoſition a place amongſt them, that are beſt to bee liked. Which Iam the willinger to doe, becauſe it agreeth alſo, with an other, that is of good likelihood. I ſhewed euen <note place="margin">Rollochus ad hunc locum.</note> now, that the Iewes generally, rulers and people, had no ſmall opinion of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt. This perhaps might preiudice our Sauiour CHRIST, as wee ſee it did, with the diſciples of <hi>Iohn;</hi> who came to their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and complained of CHRIST, that he had tooke <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 26.</note> vpon him to baptize, and was followed by all men. To take away this doubt, it is thought by ſome, that our Euangeliſt brings in this diſcourſe, wherein he makes <hi>Iohn</hi> inferior to Chriſt; and (as it may ſeeme) not without neede, becauſe (ordinarily) he that comes to <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Ioan. hom. 4.</note> beare witnes of any mans credit, or autority, is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or as grear reputation, as himſelfe.</p>
            <p>These might bee ſome reaſons, why our Euangeliſt makes mention of <hi>Iohn</hi> but (me thinkes) it may farder bee added, that hee doth apply this teſtimonie to the confirmation of that he had formerly deliuered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Sauiours being the light. Therefore ſaith he in particular, that <hi>Iohn</hi> came to beare witnes of the light, not onely to teſtifie that our Sauiour was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaih. Not, withſtanding; I would not haue any man think, it is my meaning to reſtraine the teſtimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> to this particular of the light, where of hee makes no eſpeciall
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21009:135"/> mention by any record of this, or the other Euangeliſts: but this I ſay, that therefore this witnes of <hi>Iohn</hi> is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, becauſe the Iewes hauing ſo high a conceit of <hi>Iohn,</hi> could not reaſonably chooſe, but be extraordinarily well perſwaded of him, for his power to inlighten the world, whom <hi>Iohn</hi> their famous Prophet preferred, in all his Sermons, ſo farre before himſelfe. <hi>Iohn</hi> was as the day. ſfarre, whoſe appearance giues notice of the ſunnes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Hee is a light, that brings the dawning of the day: but hee is not that light, which ſhines to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning of the world, as the ſunne doth; who is truly, and properly called the light of the world. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore take this place, as a teſtimonie of Chriſt by <hi>Iohn,</hi> then as a compariſon betwixt him, and <hi>Iohn.</hi> As if our Euangeliſt, ſhould haue ſaid; <hi>That which I haue auouched of him, whome wee ſet before you, to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in, as the Meſſiah, is no more, then was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by no meane man, Iohn the Baptiſt ſent from God to beare witneſſe of him, that from him onely, life, and light was to bee receiued. Hee came to beare witneſſe of the light, that all men, through him might beleeue.</hi> He was not the light, but the forerunner of the light, to ſhew the comming of it.</p>
            <p>Thus then is the Euangeliſt to be vnderſtood, that in this verſe, and the two next, he confirmes that, which he from the beginning had affirmed, that our Sauiour, of whom hee writes this Goſpell, was the Meſſiah, His autoritie was ſufficient, as being the worde of an Apoſtle: but that all excuſe might be taken away from peruerſe &amp; vnbeleeuing me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he addes the teſtimonie of one, whoſe memory, when <hi>Iohn</hi> penned this hiſtory, was freſh, and famous; yea of ſuch account amongſt al, that knew him, by their owne experience, or report of others, that hee muſt needes bee held to bee very vnciuill, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ordinarie men, and impious in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of as many, as were religious, that would call
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21009:135"/> the credit of his teſtimonie into queſtion: as if hee would haue ſpoken either raſhly of that, hee knew not, or deceitfully againſt his knowledge; <hi>Hee was ſent from GOD.</hi> Can you ſuſpect him of falſhood, whom God imploies in witneſſing the truth? Can you require more Autoritie in any man, then to haue him ſent from God? With what other commiſſion did euer any of the Prophets come? If he ſend them, we are bound to heare them. If he giue them inſtructions, they need no farder teaching.</p>
            <p>How can this be, ſaith one, that his ſending from God ſhould autorize him to ſpeake, what he liſt, and enjoyne vs to beleeue whatſoeuer he ſpeakes? Are not our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now adaies ſent from God? Are we tyed to like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? what is this els, but to make men Lords of our faith; Why haue wee renounced Popery; if wee haue changed not our eſtate, but our maiſters onely? Were we not better to reſt vpon the faith of the church in generall, then to ſubiect our ſelues to euery particular mans autoritie, by giuing credit to euery point, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers? This complaint will eaſily bee ſatisfied, if wee rightly informe our ſelues, concerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſending. All true Miniſters are ſent by, or from GOD; but not all alike: Some imediately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ordinary miniſterie of men; <hi>MOSES,</hi> and all the Prophets, and Apoſtles: Some by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſcretion of men, according to warrant giuen by GOD, in the Scriptures, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The former haue, as their calling, ſo their direction from GOD, that ſends them, in ſuch ſort, that they cannot erre, or ſtray from their commiſſion. The later, as they get the knowledge of that, they are to teach, not by reuelation of God to them, but by their prayer to God, and ſtudy in the ſcriptures: So they haue no further aſſurance of being preſerued from errour, then as they faithfully indeauour to perfect their
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21009:136"/> knowledge by the ſame meanes, whereby they attained to the beginnings thereof. So it comes often to paſſe, by our want of zeale, and faith in prayer, by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in ſtudie, and by our naturall dulneſs to conceiue, that wee miſtake the matters, whereof wee labour to informe our ſelues, and other. I ſay nothing of our corrupt affections, by which wee are ſomtimes drawne away from ſeeing that, wee ſee, and driuen to ſpeake that, wee would haue true, not that wee know to be true; of which paſſions, in regard of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, men ſo eſpecially guided by the ſpirit of God, as the Prophets, and Apoſtles were, are wholly freed.</p>
            <p>As for our witnes <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> what could there bee extraordinarie, in any mans ſending, that was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his? Doe not put me to repeat that, I deliuered before of his birth, bringing vp, and calling. Onely take, for your better ſatisfaction, the prophecies of him, and the performance of them, witneſſed in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>A voice cryeth in the wildernes</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay) Prepare yee the way of the Lord; make</hi>

               <hi>the voice of him, that cryeth in the wildernes, Make ſtraight the way of the Lord.</hi> If there bee any man, whome
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21009:136"/> this colud of witneſſes cannot perſwade, though hee deſerue not any farder inſtruction; yet let him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to our Sauiour; affirming that this Iohn was that <hi>Elias,</hi> of whom <hi>Malachy</hi> propheſied, ſaying, <hi>Behold</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I will ſend you Elias the Prophet, before the comming of the great, and fearefull day of the Lord. If ye will receiue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 14.</note> 
               <hi>it</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>This is Elias which was to come.</hi> So had the Angell <hi>Gabriell</hi> prophecied of him before, to his father <hi>Zacharie. Hee ſhall goe before him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>in the ſpirit, and power of Elias.</hi> There can poſſibly bee no doubt then, but that hee, which was in ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſort, ſent from GOD, both could, and would teſtifie, according to the truth, hee had receiued by reuelation from him, who imploied him in ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Is it not ſtrange then, yea almoſt more then incredible, that the Iewes, for whoſe ſake principally, if not only a meſſenger of ſuch credit, and authoritie, was ſent, ſhould ſo diſtaſt the chiefe point, and the very ſubſtance of his Meſſage? I intend not to make any long diſcourſe of the matter, becauſe I ſhall haue more iuſt occaſion thereof at the 11. verſe: Yet I can not paſte it ouer wholly in ſilence. At his circumciſion, all that heard <note place="margin">Luke 1. 60. Ver. 63. Ver. 64.</note> what had happened; that his mother againſt the liking of her kinred, and freinds, would needs haue him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Iohn,</hi> that his father tooke writing tables, and ſet downe the ſame name, that therevpon he was reſtored to the vſe of his ſpeech, hauing bin dumbe at the leaſt 9. or 10. monethes; all I ſay that heard theſe things were ſtriken with feare, and wonder, ſaving one to another; <hi>What manner of Child ſhall this be?</hi> Now the time was come, that they might caſt off that feare, and ſatisfie themſelues, concerning that their wondring. He was growne to mans eſtate, hee betooke himſelfe to the worke of his calling; hee perſwaded, and exhorted all men to repent; he ſhewed them the Meſſiah; he ſpake
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21009:137"/> plainely of him, as no prophet euer could, that no man could doubt, whom he meant. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> What could they deſire more? If the autoritie of the ſpeaker might preuaile with them; <hi>All men held Iohn</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 26.</note> 
               <hi>for a Prophet.</hi> If the warrant of his Doctrine were lookt for; the people were generally of opinion, that hee had it from heauen: So that the Phariſes &amp; Scribes, durſt not ſay the contrary, for feare of the multitude. What then? Did hee ſpeake obſcurely, and darkely, after the manner of prophecies? Hee pointed to the perſon with his finger. <hi>This is hee, of whome I ſaid, After mee commeth a man which is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

               <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> 
               <hi>the world.</hi> I may well take vp the complaint of the Prophet <hi>I ſay</hi> againſt this people in the like caſe: <hi>What</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>could the Lord haue done more for them, then he did? Iohn</hi> Baptiſt came neither eating nor drinking, but leading ſo auſtere a life, that the very Heathen were moued with reuerence toward him. <hi>Herod feared Iohn, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 6. 20.</note> 
               <hi>that hee was a iuſt man, and an holy, and reuerenced him; and when he heard him, did many things, and heard him gladly:</hi> But it was a ſmall matter for the Iewes to make little accompt of <hi>Herods</hi> iudgement, concerning the Baptiſt; it was much they ſhould not beleeue a man, whom they thought to be ſent from God.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially conſidering the end of his ſending, which <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> wee haue ſet downe in theſe two next verſes; <hi>The ſame came for a witnes, to beare witneſſe of the light, &amp;c.</hi> In the former whereof wee are firſt to ſpeake of his office, both in the generall, that he came for a witnes, and in the particular, that hee was to beare witneſs of the light. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we muſt conſider the amplification of this his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by the end; <hi>That all men through him might beleeue:</hi> and in the next verſe, by a deniall of the contrarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>he was not the light; and a repetition of the office, but was</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:21009:137"/> 
               <hi>ſent to beare witnes of the light.</hi> In the firſt part, there is no neede of any long expoſition of the words, they are ſo plaine: onely ſomwhat muſt be ſaid of the laſt of them, <hi>a witnes.</hi> The Greeke worde doth not ſignifie a partie that is to bee <hi>witnes,</hi> but rather the teſtimonie it ſelfe, <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> which hee muſt giue. Therefore our <hi>Rhemists</hi> take aduantage to make the text as hard, and vnpleaſant, as they can. <hi>Hee came for teſtimonie,</hi> ſay they. For te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie? What Engliſh ſhould a man pick out of ſuch a ſtrange kinde of ſpeech? Surely if any thing can reaſonably bee made of it, wee muſt vnderſtand <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie for teſtimoniall;</hi> as if the Euangeliſt had meant to tell vs, that <hi>Iohns</hi> comming was for teſtimoniall. But hee had no ſuch thought. For hee came not to haue any teſtimony of this, or that from other men, but to giue teſtimonie himſelfe to other. So that neither the worde teſtimonie may bee put for teſtimoniall; nor if it might, could it ſerue to expreſſe Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Which is nothing elſe, but that the Baptiſt came to beare, or giue witnes. The phraſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diuers in the two clauſes: but the ſenſe is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely one, and the ſame. May wee then ſo expound our Popiſh tranſlation of the <hi>Rhemiſts? This man</hi> (ſay they) <hi>came for teſtimonie;</hi> that is, to giue teſtimony. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that is the thing that our Euangeliſt would haue vs know: but the Engliſh will not beare it; <hi>For teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, For to giue teſtimonie:</hi> But ſuch ſtrange, and new language, may ſuite with their ſtrange, and new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Engliſh eares miſlike the manner of their ſpeech, as Chriſtian hearts doe the points of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Wee commonly tranſlate the words, <hi>for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> fitly in regard of the ſenſe, and eaſily for all mens <note place="margin">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>In teſtimonium.</hi>
               </note> vnderſtanding: <hi>This ſame came for a witnes;</hi> that is, <hi>This man, who I ſaid was ſent from God, came to bee a witneſs.</hi> The Euangeliſts manner of ſpeech is not fully deliuered: who according to the cuſtome of the tongue hee writ in,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:21009:138"/> ſaith, worde for word, he came to teſtimonie, namely to giue teſtimonie; which the Latin alſo followes, though that language doe ſcarce beare it ſo well, as the Greeke doth. To draw into Engliſh ſuch kinde of phraſes is not to inrich the tongue, but to corrupt it. Wee haue no way to expreſſe the Euangeliſts ſpeech and meaning in Engliſh, but to ſay, <hi>To giue or beare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, or witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was then the office of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, To be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now the vſe of witneſſes is, for the confirmation of ſome truth, or for manifeſtation of it. For where there is no doubt, nor queſtion; howſoeuer perhaps in forme of Lawe, there may bee witneſſes required: yet indeede there needes none. Where there is neede of them, there the matter is not plaine in it ſelfe, or at the leaſt not acknowledged to bee true. So that the point, for which <hi>Iohns</hi> teſtimonie is to bee had, hath of its owne nature, or by the ignorance, or peruerſeneſs of men, ſomthing not cleere, or not confeſt. What if it haue? Could not God haue made it manifeſt, by ſome teſtimonie, from himſelfe, without ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe oſſending a witnes, as it were downe from heauen? Yes out of doubt. He, that made the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of man, can make man vnderſtand what pleaſeth him. He, that framed the heart, can perſwade, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it, to what himſelfe liſt. But all ſuch courſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation from God, were as extraordinarie as ſuch a kind of birth and meſſage; and both the one and the other little enough in this caſe: as the euent ſhewed. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord teſtified of his ſonne, by his owne voice from heauen, and by <hi>Iohn</hi> vpon earth, yet was he ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged by any man. As for the work of Gods mighty power in the ſoules of them, that come to beleefe in Chriſt, it was not wanting to any of theſe Iewes, who aduiſedly &amp; religiouſly gaue credit to the teſtimonie of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, or ſet themſelues to conſider of it, as they
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21009:138"/> ought to haue done; which if they had done, it was not poſſible, but they ſhould haue ſeene, both the loue of God in ſending them ſuch worthy meanes of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the truth of that, which <hi>Iohn</hi> deliuered by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him. Dooſt thou wonder at the blindnes, and frowardnes of the Iewes, whome the teſtimony of a man (in their owne iudgement) not to bee excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, could not moue to beleeue? View thy ſelf in this glaſſe. and conſider whether more witneſſes, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by thee to be ſent from God, &amp; to ſpeake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth of God, be not of as ſmall credit with thee, in many points, wherein thy obedience is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>But of this, more anone, when wee haue a little better examined, of what kinde, this teſtimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> was. <hi>That he might beare witneſſe of the light.</hi> The words haue beene all expounded already: in the matter there are theſe two thinges to bee conſidered; what manner of teſtimony it was, that <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue; what it was that he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. A teſtimony, as all men knowe, is ordinarily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by word of mouth: wherein ſome matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is either affirmed, or denied; and they, that giue theſe teſtimonies, are called witneſſes. Amongſt Chriſtians there is another kinde of witneſſes, tearmed Martyrs by the Greeke name: which is common to all, that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie any thing, eſpecially in matters of Law, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſame word is heere vſed, to ſignifie the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that <hi>Iohn</hi> bare. Thoſe, whome wee call Martyrs, are ſuch, as, by their death, beare witneſſe to ſome truth of God, reuealed in his word; ſuffering themſelues to bee tormented, and murthered, rather then they will denie, or not confeſſe a knowne truth of God, when they are lawfully demanded of it. Such was <hi>Stephen,</hi> and ſo is hee called by <hi>Paul; When the bloud of thy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act 22. 20,</note> 
               <hi>Martyr Stephen was ſhed.</hi> The ſame title is giuen <note place="margin">Reuel. 2. 13.</note> to <hi>Antipas,</hi> whome our Sauiour calles his Martyr,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21009:139"/> 
               <hi>when Antipas my faithfull Martyr was ſtaine among you.</hi> For this cauſe Chriſt himſelfe is named a Martyr: <hi>from Ieſus Christ which is a faithfull Martyr or witneſſe; and the first begotten of the dead.</hi> As for <hi>Iohn,</hi> who knowes not that hee was put to death by <hi>Herod,</hi> for dooing his dutie, in witneſſing a trueth of GOD? Yet hee is not thought to bee any of the Martyrs, that giue witneſſe by their death; becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly helde, that the dying for no trueth makes a Martyr, vnleſſe the trueth concerne ſomewhat belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the profeſſion of the Goſpell: ſo that neither <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> nor any of the Prophets, are properly to be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Martyrs. I will not ſtriue about the point: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince I doe but touch this by the way; onely for <hi>Iohn,</hi> I thinke hee is not properly to bee recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the number of the Martyrs: not ſo much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter, for which hee reprooued <hi>Herod,</hi> did not appertaine, in any particular ſort, to the Goſpell as for that he was not executed profeſſedly for that, he had ſayde, and did conſtantly mainetaine; but for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Kings promiſe, and <hi>Horodias</hi> malice: but whether that bearing witneſſe could make him a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, or no, queſtionleſſe it was not that, which our Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt here ſpeakes of; for it was not any teſtimonie of the <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How then did <hi>Iohn</hi> beare witneſſe? By preaching of Chriſt; and auowing, that hee was the Meſſiah orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and ſent for the ſaluation of them, that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him. This (may ſome man ſay) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him, with the Prophets (at the leaſt, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them) and with all the Apoſtles, that ſucceeded him, who alſo therefore are called in the ſcripture by the name of witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Let vs make that wee ſay, apparant to all men. Firſt, for them all in generall, <hi>Zachary</hi> the Father of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, ſpeaking of our Sauiour, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And that not without cauſe. For hee hath ſpoken very plainely of the birth, life, and death of our Sauiour. Concerning his birth, hee noteth that, which was moſt ſtrange in it; and which, but by reuelation from God, could not poſſibly bee knowne, or thought on, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>a Virgin ſhal</hi>

The couetous <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 12. 14.</note> Publicans, were content to heare him reprooue their greedineſſe, and extor ion.

What ſhould I ſpeake of the proud Phariſes, who had bewitcht all <note place="margin">Mat. 3 7.</note> men with an opinion of their purity, and holineſſe, and none more then themſelues? yet were they glad to come to <hi>Iohn</hi> to be waſhed, and purified by his Baptiſme.

            <p>In the meane while, let vs go forward with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of this Scripture; wherein (as we haue heard) the office of <hi>Iohn</hi> is amplified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this verſe, by the ende of it, <hi>That all men through, or by him, might beleeue.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that I may ſpeake the more plainely, and certainely, I will firſt examin what this ende is; <hi>To beleeue by him:</hi> Secondly I will conſider the quality of it, or who they were that ſhould beleeue. The former hath theſe two doubts, what is here meant by belieuing: to whom this <hi>Him</hi> muſt be reffer'd whether to <hi>Iohn</hi> the witneſſe, or to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:21009:143"/> the light, of which he bears witnes, <hi>might beleeue through him.</hi> Now, becauſe <hi>Beleeuing</hi> is a word of ſo common &amp; great vſe in the Scriptures, and that this is the firſt place, where it is mentioned in this Goſpell; I hold it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſit, but neceſſary for me, to ſpeake of it ſomwhat more at large. <hi>To beleeue,</hi> in matter of religion, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken to ſignifie 3 things: The acknowledging of Gods being; <hi>Credere Deum,</hi> To beleeue <hi>that God is,</hi> or <hi>that there is a God: Credere Deo,</hi> To <hi>giue credit</hi> to that, <hi>which God ſaith: Credere in Deum, To beleeue in God.</hi> And of all theſe ſignifications, wee haue variety of examples in the Scripture. Giue me leaue, I pray you, for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtanding, &amp; memory, to draw them to 2 prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall heades, according to the diuers ſeat, or place, they haue in the ſoule of man. To beleeue then, is to holde ſomething for truth, or to truſt to ſomething. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is an action of the vnderſtanding; the later of the will. In the one truth only is reſpected; the other hath an eie to ſome good, or benefit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beleeuing,</hi> as it hath place in the vnderſtanding, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies either an holding of ſome point as a truth, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall light of nature in vs, or an aſſenting to ſom ſuch thing reuealed by ſome outward meanes, &amp; taken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the credit of the teacher. Of the 1. kind is the perſuaſion, that all men naturally haue, that <hi>there is one God;</hi> that <hi>hee is the Creator of heauen, and earth;</hi> that <hi>he is almighty, wiſe, iuſt, good &amp;c.</hi> Theſe things, men are truly, and properly, ſaid to beleeue, becauſe they are not taught them, but bred in them; they receiue them not of other, but haue them of themſelues; they come not to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, by any diſcourſe of reaſon, but ſee them by a light, that ſhines within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>Thevſe of the worde being (as hath beene ſaid) ſo diuerſe; in what ſenſe ſhall we take it, in this text? That we ſhall knowe, by vnderſtanding, what it was, that <hi>Iohn</hi> laboured to perſwade men to, by his preaching. For wee haue learned, that his witneſſe beareing, was <hi>Teaching:</hi> and wee ſee heere, that the ende of his teaching was, <hi>Beleefe, that all men might beleeue.</hi> What was this beleeuing? Onely an aſlenting to the truth of that, which they heard <hi>Iohn</hi> deliuer? If that had beene all, ſurely hee would neuer haue taken ſo much paines, and ſpent ſo much time, in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all men, to conſider their owne eſtate, and in convincing them of ſinne, that they might finde, in what neede they ſtood of deliuerance by the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> But that I may make as ſhort, as I can, wee may fetch the aunſwere to this doubt from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> who thus deſcribes the office, and doctrine of <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt. Iohn verely baptized</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 19. 4.</note> 
               <hi>with the baptiſme of repentance</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſaying vnto the people, that they ſhould beleeue in him which ſhould come after him, that is, in Christ Ieſus.</hi> So then, whereas our Euangeliſt tells vs, that the ende of <hi>Iohns</hi> comming was, <hi>that all men ſhoulde beleeue,</hi> hee giues vs to vnderſtand, that hee taught men the myſtery of redemption by Chriſt (though not ſo diſtinctly as it was afterwarde deliuered) with a purpoſe, and deſire, that they ſhoulde take our Sauiour CHRIST for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and reſt vpon him, that their ſinnes might bee taken away. <hi>Beholde</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the lambe of God</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:21009:146"/> 
               <hi>that taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> It is true, that <hi>beleeuing</hi> properly ſignifieth no more, but giuing credit, or aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth; but ſeeing wee finde the ende of <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching to reach farder then ſo, wee muſt needs hold that the other degrees of beleeuing are implied in this one and firſt ſtep to faith, <hi>by which we are iuſtified.</hi> The like we are to conceiue of the word, whereſoeuer in the new Teſtament wee finde that aſcribed to beleeuing, which cannot be attain'd to, but by faith in Chriſt. I wil indeavor to make this plaine by an example or two. <hi>He</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that beleeueth, &amp; is baptized, ſhallbe ſaued.</hi> What is meant here, by <hi>beleeuing?</hi> Nothing, but aſſenting to that, which the Apoſtles taught, in regard of the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? But that cannot bring ſaluation to any man; which is not to be obtain'd, without reſting vpon Chriſt for iuſtification. Therefore to beleeue, in that text of <hi>Mark,</hi> is as much as, to beleeue in Chriſt, or to rely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt for ſaluation. Doſt <hi>thou beleeue in the Sonne of God?</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 35.</note> our Sauiour to the man, whome hee had before reſtored to his ſight. <hi>He anſwered and ſaid, Who is hee Lord, that I may beleeue in him? And Ieſus ſaid, Both thou haſt ſeene him &amp; he it is that talketh with thee. Then he ſaid Lord I beleeue.</hi> What did he beleeue? That Chriſt was the Son of God. Was that all? Our Sauiour asked him, if hee did beleeue in the Sonne of God. Had it beene ſufficient for him to profeſſe, that he beleeued him to be the Sonne of God? No ſure. But it behoued him for the anſwering of the queſtion, to affirme that he beleeued in him. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to heape vp any more examples; Theſe fewe may ſerue to teach vs, that <hi>beleeuing</hi> is ſometimes put, for <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in Christ.</hi> If it pleaſe you to take a view of other places of the ſame kind, I doubt not, but you will bee confirmed in the truth of this obſeruation.</p>
            <p>The ende then of <hi>Iohns</hi> bearing witneſſe was, <hi>that all men through him might beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt to ſaluation.</hi> There is yet an other doubt, who it is, that the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21009:146"/> meanes by <hi>Him, through him.</hi> Through whome? For the word in the Greeke may agree either to <hi>Iohn</hi> the witneſſe, or to the light, whereof hee beares witneſſe: though in our Engliſh there is a plaine difference; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we would haue it vnderſtood of <hi>Iohn,</hi> wee muſt tranſlate the word, as we do, <hi>Him:</hi> but if we referre it to the light, we muſt ſay <hi>It, that all men by it might beleeue.</hi> Let vs ſee now to whether of the 2 the worde muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. By light (as it is apparant) our Sauiour Chriſt is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: ſo that if we vnderſtand it of the light, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that all men ſhould beleeue by Chriſt. But this is a ſtrange kind of ſpeech, without al warrant of example from the Scripture, concerning him. <hi>To beleeue Chriſt, To beleeue in</hi> or <hi>on Chriſt,</hi> are vſuall, and ordinary: but to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue by Chriſt,</hi> is a phraſe with which the Scripture is not acquainted. And whereas ſome men would defend the applying of this to the light, by expounding it, <hi>that men through Chriſt, might beleeue in God;</hi> they affirme that of Chr. which the Scripture neuer ſpeaketh of him. Where is it ſaid of him, that he taught men to beleeue in God? Once in this Goſpell, hee mentions beleeuing in God; but as a thing, to which they needed no inſtruction of his; becauſe they did already performe that duty. <hi>Ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Beleeue alſo in mee:</hi> I deny not, that <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 1.</note> the Iewes needed to be taught by our Sauiour, how they ought to belieue in God; but I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee why we ſhould imagin, that the Euangeliſt woulde, in this place, ſpeake of ſuch a point, as he no where toucheth, in any other part of his Goſpell. It is beſt therefore to tranſlate, as we read it; and to vnderſtand it, not of Chriſt, but of <hi>Iohn:</hi> who was ſent to beare witneſſe of the light, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Iewes, that Ieſus was he, by whom they were to receiue life, and light; that they being thus inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and perſwaded by him, might beleeue in Chriſt, to the obtaining of euerlaſting life: and this was the ende of <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery.</p>
            <pb n="290" facs="tcp:21009:147"/>
            <p>For the farder comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation wherof, ſome alleage the generality of it, that it belongd to all, Iewes, &amp; Gentils, one, and other, without exception, as the words (they ſay) manifeſtly proue; <hi>that all men through him might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi> It is not my deſire, nor purpoſe, to ſpeak any thing, that may darken the glory of ſo honorable a calling, as <hi>Iohns</hi> was: as it might, and (I hope) did appeare, when I handled the point of his witnes-bearing. But But I am now to ſeeke out the meaning of that, which our Euangeliſt heere reporteth, not to apply my ſelfe to ſet forth the largeneſſe of <hi>Iohns</hi> commiſſion, or the excellency of his office. The queſtion is, how far theſe wordes, <hi>All men,</hi> are to be ſtretcht, according to the true intent, and meaning of the Euangeliſt. What needs any queſtion of this matter? ſaith one. The Euangeliſt hath ſpoken plaine enough. Let the wordes haue their full courſe, and reſtraine not that to ſome, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to all. If the like ſpeeches were alwaies in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of as large extent, in the holy Ghoſts meaning, as they are in their owne nature; there might be no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, but that in this place they were ſo to be taken. But who is ignorant, that often times in Scripture, the generall ſenſe of the worde muſt bee limitted to ſome particulars? For example, in this very caſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn;</hi> Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith, <hi>That, All Iudea and all the Region about Iordan went out to him:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat 3 5.</note> VVho is ſo vnreaſonable, as to expound this <hi>All,</hi> of all men, woemen, and children? Yea who dare avouch it of all men, or preciſely of the greater part? The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt followeth the ordinary cuſtome of mens daily ſpeech, who, to ſignifie a great number, are wont to ſay <hi>All:</hi> Such is that common phraſe, <hi>All men,</hi> or <hi>all the world knowes it.</hi> And of the ſame kind is that in the Goſpell, though not ſo large; <hi>All holde Iohn as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 26.</note> and yet there might be many, that perhaps had ſcarſly heard of him: but (generally) hee was taken to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21009:147"/> be a Prophet.</p>
            <p>Shall I alleage a ſtraunger kind of ſpeech, for proofe of that, I haue affirmed? <hi>As in Adam all men dy; So in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt ſhall all bee made aliue.</hi> Here is the very ſame worde twice vſed, and yet diuerſly. <hi>All,</hi> in the firſt part of the verſe, ſignifies euery man, woman, and child, that came from <hi>Adam</hi> by naturall propagation. But in the later part it is reſtrained to certaine men, as the next verſe makes it plaine: <hi>But euery man in his</hi>

               <hi>order: The firſt fruites is Chriſts, afterward they that are Chriſts.</hi> Thoſe <hi>All</hi> are no more, but ſuch, as are Chriſts.

If you preſſe mee with the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt <hi>Adam, and Christ,</hi> to conclude from thence, that <hi>All</hi> muſt bee as generall in the later clauſe, as in the former; firſt we haue heard the Apoſtles limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>They, that are Chriſts:</hi> Secondly, conſider the ſimilitude of the firſt fruites, which ſanctifie none, but their owne lumpe: and the wicked are not one lumpe with Chriſt; no more, then they are part of his body. Laſtly, conceiue alſo the reaſon of this diuerſity, and the oppoſition will ſtand, for all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. <hi>In Adam all men dy:</hi> ſimply all men, not one excepted, of any age, ſex, or condition. Why ſo? Becauſe euery man, woman, and child was in <hi>Adam,</hi> when hee ſinned, and is naturally deſcended from <hi>Adam.</hi> Shall all men in like ſort be made aliue in Chriſt? Not ſimply all; becauſe all are not Chriſts, as all were <hi>Adams;</hi> yet is there a fit compariſon of contraries. For as all <hi>Adams</hi> dy in <hi>Adam;</hi> So all Chriſts liue in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Seeing it is ſo cleere, that the word <hi>All,</hi> neither muſt, nor may alwaies be extended to the vttermoſt of the proper ſignification thereof, I truſt no man wil raſhly condemne me, If I make inquity, whether it be ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, in this place, or no, VVould you knowe why I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21009:148"/> doubt? You haue heard the generall reaſon thereof; I will come to ſome particulars. Frſt there is no remedy, but it muſt be ſome what reſtrained, becauſe there were many thouſands, in the worlde, that could not poſſibly come to any knowledge of <hi>Iohn,</hi> or his teſtimony. Yea I may truly, and therefore boldly ſay, that the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part of men liuing, when <hi>Iohn</hi> preached, coulde not by any ordinary meanes, ſo much as haue the leaſt inkling of any ſuch matter. The time of his miniſtery exceeded not the compaſſe of 3 yeeres; he trauailed not as the Apoſtles did afterward, from Country to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 3.</note> but keept himſelfe within the bounds of the lande, that God beſtowed vpon the Iewes, and there only imployed himſelf How then ſhould al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world take knowledge of his doctrine? And how ſtraungely did hee carry himſelfe, in the diſcharge of his duty, if being ſent to al men, whereſoeuer, he kept continually in the Country, where hee was borne, and bred? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the prophecies concerning <hi>Iohn,</hi> are peculiar to the Iews, and no mention in them of any other people. <hi>Comfort yee my people; Speake comfortably to Ieruſalem.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 40. 1. 2. 3</note> 
               <hi>A voice crieth in the wilderneſſe.</hi> There was his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aboade, <hi>till the time came</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Luke) that hee</hi>

               <hi>ſhould ſhewe himſelfe to Iſraell.</hi> To whome dooth <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> prophecy of his comming, but only to the Iewes, <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> without any mention of the Gentiles; which yet is not omitted, where that, which is prophecied of, belongs <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 5. 6.</note> vnto them? <hi>Behold I will ſend you the Prophet Eliah &amp;c. And he ſhall turne the hearts of the Fathers to the children.</hi> Of what fathers, to what children? Is it not manifeſt, that <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 16.</note> this is proper to the Iewes? <hi>Many of the children of Iſraell</hi> (ſaith the Angel to <hi>Zachary)ſhall he turne to their Lord God.</hi> And hee confirmes his ſpeech by that teſtimony of <hi>Malachy.</hi> Can you ſhew mee the like warrant or any at all, concerning his conuerting of the Gentiles? I doe not ſay, that there was neuer a one of the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21009:148"/> heathen, proſelyte, or other, that had the vſe, and benefit of the Baptiſts miniſtery; but this was extraordinary, &amp; by an eſpecial mercy of God to thoſe men, not by the generall intendement of the Lorde to all the Gentiles. Thirdly we muſt remember, that the miniſtery of Chriſt himſelfe, was confined to the land of Iury, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be common to all the world. Therefore is hee called the miniſter of the circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; his office ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Rom 15. 8.</note> deſcrib'd; <hi>for the truth of God to confirme the promiſe to the fathers.</hi> And accordingly he <hi>profeſſed, that hee was not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 24.</note> 
               <hi>ſent, but to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſraell.</hi> Not as if the benefit of his mediation, and redemption, were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Iewes, and Gentiles; but for that his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in his owne perſon, was appointed only for the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits howſoeuer ſome one of the heathen, heere and there, might lay hold on him, to ſaluation, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by his preaching. <hi>Iohn</hi> then, who was to prepare the way for the <hi>Meſſiahs</hi> perſon, had his commiſſion accordingly, not for all the worlde, but for the Iewes only.</p>
            <p>I might add many other proofs to the ſame purpoſe, but theſe few are ſufficient; both to ſhewe their miſvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this place, who would build the doctrin of vniuerſall grace vpon it, and to direct vs, to the true meaning of the holy Ghoſt therein. For the matter it ſelfe, whether God haue made no difference, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing election to everlaſting life, betwixt one man, and an other, but haue equally ordained all men therevnto or no, I will not, nor may, vpon this occaſion, diſpute; only it was neceſſary for me, to put you in mind that no ſuch doctrine can be gathered out of this place. The reaſon thereof is double; as well becauſe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Iohn,</hi> is not appointed by God for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery particular man in the worlde: as alſo for that it is one thinge to ſay, God affoordes all men the meanes of ſaluation (ſuppoſing that to be true,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21009:149"/> which I am out of doubt no man can proue) &amp; another thing to affirme, that God intends the ſaluation of euery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>euerall man whatſoeuer. But of this enough for the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent. It remains, that I deliuer the true meaning of theſe words; <hi>All men:</hi> which (as I haue prou'd) muſt bee parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly vnderſtood of the Iewes. This being granted, there ariſeth yet an other queſtion; whether vnder this <hi>All,</hi> euery one of the Iewes be compriſed, or no. But me thinks this point ſhould be out of queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; becauſe many of the Iews, were at that time ſcattered abroad in diuers Countries, ſo that they could neither come to <hi>Iohn,</hi> to receiue the word, &amp; baptiſme by his miniſtry, nor could haue any ſuch knowledge of that, he taught, as that by it, they might be brought to belieue in Ieſus Chriſt for ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Some men therefore haue thought it moſt fit to ty this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enerall word to all the elect, amongſt the Iews; as if the Euangeliſt had inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to teach vs, that the end of <hi>Iohns</hi> ſending was, that al thoſe Iews, whom God had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to euerlaſting life, might belieue. And ſurely if it were the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt, to reueal vnto vs the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> what I think, without preiudice to any mans iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeems to me, not ſo agreeable to the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts purpoſe as to make the end of <hi>Iohns</hi> witnes-bearing, as general as reaſonably we may. For it is ſomewhat liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ception, in the opinion of al men, that ſhal read, or heare this point, to affirme, that the Lord would haue ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like a miniſtery reſtrained to ſome few; if he had bard a men, ſaue ſome few, from beleeuing. Wherfore I had ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther take it as in definitly ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without reſpect of theſe or thoſe men, <hi>that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might beleeue;</hi> yet ſtil with reſtrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to <hi>the Iewes.</hi> Which in the originall may more eaſily bee done, becauſe the word <hi>men</hi> being not expreſt, we may
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:21009:149"/> reaſonably vnderſtand in place of it the Iewes. <hi>That all might beleeue:</hi> namely <hi>that all the Iewes,</hi> to whom only he was ſent, might beleeue. And ſo may we alſo very well, and fitly tranſlate it, leauing out <hi>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then? How ſhall we vnderſtand the place? Firſt we muſt expound it of none, but the Iewes; becauſe to them only <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſent. Secondly, we muſt know, that it concernes them all without exception, one &amp; other. Thirdly, let vs remember, that heere is no thought of Gods ſecret election, but the ende of the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn</hi> propounded. The meaning then is this, that <hi>God ſent Iohn to beare witneſſe, that Ieſus was the light, to the end that all, to whom he was ſent, might acknowledge the Meſſiah and reſt vpon him for ſaluation.</hi> What? Euery one of the Iewes? I: Euery one, none excepted. As concerning the preaching of <hi>Iohn;</hi> had he any commiſſion from God, to deny any man his helpe, in teaching, and baptiſing? Had any man charge from God, not to heare, or not to be baptiſed? Did the Lord with hold any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or comming to baptiſme? Did hee put a miſlike of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his miniſtery into any mans hart? Did he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh any ſuch conceit, or incline any man to the retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it? It is true indeed, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was to execute his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice only in Iewry, and not to ſeeke out the Iewes in the ſeuerall Countries, where they were diſperſed. But this doth not proue, that his miniſtery therfore belongd not to them. There was great reaſon why he ſhould abide in thoſe parts. There was our Sauiour to bee borne; there to bee baptiſed by him; there to be ſhowne to the people. That was the lande, in which the people, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſent, had their ordinary, and proper dwelling. And though many were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:21009:150"/> was <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery, in reſpect of the common end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as free for them, as for any other of the Iews what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, that they might haue beleeued.</p>
            <p>And ſhall any of them, that haue periſht, through their own default, or ſhal any Proctor for them open his mouth, to blame the iuſtice, or deny the mercy of God, in prouiding for their ſaluation? What doſt thou cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp to heauen, and prying into the hidden coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of God, to accuſe him, or excuſe them? <hi>Iohn was ſent to beare witneſſe, that all men might beleeue.</hi> Did he not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ſhew himſelfe to all, that would ſee him? Did he forbid, or diſcourage any man from hearing? If at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time he ſeem'd to driue men, from him, it was to driue them to Chriſt. I graunt, he was meane in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, homely in his diet, ſolitary in his conuerſation, ſharpe in his reproofes. But he was faithfull, and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his miniſtery. Though hee rebuked many, that came to his baptiſme; yet the refuſed none, that confeſt their ſinnes. It was not his purpoſe to with-hold bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme from any man; but to prepare all men, that they might bee fit receiuers of it. But what ſpend I time, in defending of <hi>Iohn?</hi> Theſe mens quarrell is not to him, but to God. Alas poore wretches! Whome do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke? How will they be able to maintaine their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell? Nay rather: <hi>O deſperat miſcreants!</hi> O prophane blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers! Was God in fault, that they beleeu'd not? Did he not promiſe them often, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhoulde come? Did he not ſend his Angel, euen <hi>Gabriell,</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the preciſe time of his comming? Did hee not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould preach vnto them, <hi>That hee might</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>turne the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, leaſt he ſhould come, and ſmite the earth with curſing?</hi> And, as if all this had beene a ſmall matter, did hee not take order, that his promiſes ſhould be left in writing, to the ende that all men might know them? Where was the fault now, that theſe things were
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21009:150"/> not knowne, and beleeued? Many of them could not read theſe prophecies. But God had made euerie one of them capable of skill to read. If their parents neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the meanes, or if themſelues reguarded not the knowledge, ſhall God beare the blame of their ſinne, and folly? Will you except againſt the hardneſſe of the points, as they are deliuered, in the prophecies of the olde Teſtament? Nay, rather condemne the hardneſſe of their hearts, that would not vnderſtand that, which (as for thoſe times) was plainly, and manifeſtly taught.</p>
            <p>There was none ſo ſimple, or ignorant amongſt them, but he had heard of the Meſſiah. None almoſt ſo careleſſe, but lookt for his comming. None ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but hoped for ſome good by his comming. Why then did they refuſe him? Refuſe him ſaid I? Nay; why did they denie him, diſgrace him, hate him, perſecute him, murther him? Becauſe they knewe him not. Did they not know him? But they might haue done, if they had beleeued <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, that teſtified of him. But let all them goe. Admitte they <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 46.</note> had giuen no tokens, by which the Meſſiah, when hee ſhould come, might be knowne. I will vrge none, but <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts teſtimony; or rather I will not vrge it, but name it. <hi>Iohn</hi> is ſent to them, as it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne amongſt them, after an extraordinarie manner; his father, and mother being very olde, and ſhe all her life time time verie barren. An Angell brings his father a meſſage from God, that his wife ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and appoints him to call the child <hi>Iohn.</hi> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes doubt of this promiſe, is threatned, and ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with dumbneſſe thereupon; which (according to the Angels threatning) continues, till the child be born. The eight day after, when hee is to bee circumciſed, the mother names him <hi>Iohn:</hi> the kindred except againſt it, becauſe none of their Aunceſtors, or ſtocke haue beene ſo called. His fathers opinion is required. Hee makes
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:21009:151"/> ſignes for a payre of writing Tables, and confirmes his wiues direction, by his conſent thus written, <hi>His name is Iohn.</hi> Preſently hereupon, <hi>his mouth is opened, and his tongue looſed;</hi> and by the ſpirit of prophecy, hee breakes out into a pſalme of prayſe, and thankeſgiuing to God. Theſe things are noyſed all about thoſe parts, and there is great muttering among the people, with wonder at the child, what manner of man hee will prooue. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe this admiration, the courſe of this childes life is yet more extraordinarie; hee withdrawes himſelf from the company of men, and liues in the wilderneſſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny yeares together: at the laſt, about the thirteth yeare of his age, as it were, vpon a ſodayne, <hi>He comes into all the Coasts about Iordan preaching the baptiſme of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> In a ſhort time, his fame growes ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Conſider now I beſeech you, a little, the ſtrange, and wilfull blindneſſe of this people. <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> was a man, in that credit, and fauour with them, that hee might haue beene taken for the Meſſiah, if hee would haue taken the office vpon him. Hee tels them, he is not the man; he aſſures them vpon his reputation, that Ieſus is hee: to whome hee doth ſo much ſubmit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Doth <hi>Iohn</hi> want authoritie, to moue them? <hi>All men held</hi> Iohn <hi>for a Prophet.</hi> Lackes hee credite with them, or fauour? The Scribes, and Phariſes durſt not ſo much as denie, that his miniſterie was from God, for feare of the people. Perhappes his auſteritie in his priuate carriage, and publike preaching, made them growe into ſome miſlike of him. Nothing leſſe. They flockt after him by heapes. But they might ſuſpect, that it was a ſette match, betwixt Chriſt, and him, for the aduantage of them both. They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his ſinceritie, they hearde his profeſſion, that hee knew not him, to bee the Meſſiah, but by the ſigne, that God himſelfe had giuen him: They had ſeene the education of them both, in diuers places, and courſes of life. What ſhould I ſay? I am euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to thinke vpon ſo rare, and incredible, ſhall I cal it, ignorance, or obſtinacie? Let me repeat the matter in a word or two, that you may be Iudges, whether I haue cauſe to be aſtonied, or no. A people liuing vpon the hope of the Meſſiah, ſeating their happineſſe in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by him, hearkning, prying. gaping after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (hauing him ſhewed to them, by one, whom they iuſtly admired for his parts and graces, as a man indeed ſent from God) like wey warde children, reiect that, when it is offered them, which before they cryed for. Who can giue mee the reaſon of this refuſall? But what ſpeake I of reaſon, in a matter ſo vnteaſonable? who can tell mee, what pretence, or colour they had for it?</p>
            <p>Shall wee conferre with ſome of them, about the point? I would faine heare what they canne ſay for themſelues. If <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay true, why do you not beleeue him? If hee deliuer that, which is falſe, why doe yee not reproue him? Either leaue following him, if hee teach vntruths: or if yee will needes follow him, giue credite to that, he ſpeakes.</p>
            <pb n="300" facs="tcp:21009:152"/>
            <p>Is his report of Ieſus vntrue? Then why doe you wonder at him, as a Prophet ſent from heauen? Dooth hee vtter that hee knowes not? How is hee woorth the hearing? Doth he ſpeake contrarie to his knowledge? Hee is to bee hated, not hearkned to. How vnciuill are you (to ſpeake as ſparingly as I can) who ſuſpect his faithfulneſſe, whome you neuer founde in any fault? How irreligious are you that condemne him of errour, whome God ſent immediatly, for your inſtruction? Bethinke yourſelues in time, whome you refuſe, and deſpiſe. Through <hi>Iohns</hi> ſides you ſtrike at God himſelf Of him, <hi>Iohn</hi> receiued his commiſſion. From him hee had inſtruction, what to teach you. By him hee was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in teaching.</p>
            <p>In other points you acknowledge it, to his ſingular commendation. Why not in this too, which was the maine ende of his Embaſſage? At the leaſt bee not ſo vnthankfull, iniurious, blaſphemous, as not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſent to beare witneſſe, that <hi>yee might all beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue beene longer in this diſcourſe, then I purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: yet it repents me not; becauſe I doubt not, but you all perceiue, that thoſe thinges, which I haue handled, touching the Iewes, may concern vs alſo, as wel as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For although I perſwade my ſelfe, that theſe <hi>All</hi> (as I haue ſayd) are the Iewes onely: yet I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it was the good pleaſure of God, that wee alſo ſhould bee helped forward to beleefe, by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts recording this office, and teſtimony of <hi>Iohn.</hi> His bearing witneſſe did properly informe them, that heard it: but the knowledge of his extraordinary ſending, birth, education, conuerſation, preaching, and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, may, and muſt confirme the faith of all vs, that dayly heare of it. Ignorance in the nature of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias office, proud conceipt of their owne goodneſſe, &amp; doating vpon worldly pleaſures, and preferments, were
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:21009:152"/> great cauſes of their infidelitie. If wee be blinded with ſuch conceites, and drowned in ſuch gulfes, we ſhal not ſee, nor come to Chriſt for ſaluation. But wee are better inſtructed in the redemption, which is wrought by the Meſſiah, and looke not for any temporall kingdome by him. Therefore wee cannot chooſe, but diſcerne (that which the Iewes would not ſee) that Ieſus is hee, by whome the ſinne of the worlde is taken away. Onely let mee giue warning, that (ſeeing God affords vs the Goſpell, that wee might beleeue) no man be ſo wicked, or deſperat, as to except againſt the mercy of God, or his owne ſaluation, vpon pretence of I know not what conceite, erroneouſly grounded on the eternall decree of predeſtination. It is enough (for the preſent) to name it; I will ſay more of it hereafter (if it pleaſe God) vpon euerie iuſt occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, let vs proceede with that, which followes. <hi>Hee was not the light, but was ſent to beare witnes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> 
               <hi>of the light.</hi> Where the Euangeliſt deſcribes the office of <hi>Iohn,</hi> by denying that, which is contrarie vnto it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it. He denies him to be the light, he tels vs againe, that <hi>hee was ſent to beare witneſſe of the light.</hi> This later point hath beene expounded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. If the time, which is almoſt paſt, will giue mee leaue, perhappes a word or two ſhall be added. In the handling of the former, I will ſpeak ſhortly to theſe two points; that <hi>Iohn</hi> is not the light: why our Euangeliſt addes this caution, in the deſcribing of his miniſtery. For I holde it altogether needleſſe, to ſhew that <hi>Iohn</hi> is hee, of whom this <hi>being the light</hi> is denyed. There is no man, but vpon the reading of the text, diſcerns as much. Neither is it greatly needful, to inquire in what ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe <hi>Iohn</hi> is denied to bee the light, ſeeing our Sauiour profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of him, that <hi>Hee was a burning and ſhining Candle.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 35.</note> A Candle may bee without light; and a burning Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle may giue very little light, that it ſhal be very hardly
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:21009:153"/> perceiued, but a ſhining candle is light indeed. It may bee whelmed vnder a buſhell, and ſo hid, not from ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but from being ſeene to ſhine; but <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpred his light round about, that as it followes in the ſame place, <hi>the Iewes (for a ſeaſon) would haue reioyced in it.</hi> But <note place="margin">Cyrillus in Ioa. lib. 1. cap.</note> this doubt is eaſily ſatisfied. <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>a light:</hi> But not <hi>the light.</hi> What is a Candle to the Sunne? But the difference was greater, and of another kinde. The light ſhineth of it ſelfe by nature, as the Sunne dooth. A light is like the Moone, which ſhineth indeede, but by a borrowed brightneſſe receiued from the Sunne, which is the fountaine, from whence all that light ſtreames. So was the Baptiſt a light; ſo were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles the light of the worlde. Not ſhining of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note> but deliuering abroade, as a glaſſe doth from the Sunne by reflection, the light, which Chriſt the true light powred vpon, and into them, for the inlightning of others.</p>
            <p>Now, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was not the light, himſelfe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not confeſſed onely, but profeſſed. The rulers of the Iewes were ready to haue accepted him for the Meſſiah; and to that purpoſe, they ſent Prieſts, and <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 20.</note> Leuites, which by their ſecte alſo were Phariſes, to make offer to him of that honour; but <hi>Hee</hi> (ſayeth our Euangeliſt) <hi>confeſſed and denied not, and ſayde</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> 
               <hi>plainely, I am not the Chriſt.</hi> And when they preſt him farther, as if they would haue perſwaded him, that hee did but denie it for modeſtie, hee tolde them, <note place="margin">Ver. 23. Iſay. 40. 3.</note> He <hi>was the voyce, that</hi> Iſay <hi>prophecied of, crying in the wilderneſſe, that the way of the Lord might be made ſtraight.</hi> And as for his baptiſme, which as the Phariſes truely taught, and vrged, ſhewed him to bee ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man, hee wild them to conſider, that hee baptized but with water, whereas the Meſſiah ſhould baptiſe them with <hi>the holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> Yea, ſo farre doth <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 16.</note> hee worthily, and truely abaſe himſelfe, in compariſon
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:21009:153"/> of Chriſt, that he aſſures them, <hi>he is not worthy to vnty his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 27. Mat. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>ſhooelaetchet, or to carrie his ſhooes after him.</hi> And this hee ſpake not once onely, but as oft as any iuſt occaſion was offred, appealing to his Diſciples knowledge, that they <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 28.</note> could beare him witnes of his proteſtation againſt the Iewes offer, to take him for Chriſt. Therefore did he not <note place="margin">Luk. 7, 19.</note> only patiently beare the departure of his followers, to <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 2.</note> Chriſt, but alſo exhorted them to goe, and ſent them to him. Yet all this would not moue the Iewes (O men of vncircumciſed hearts, and eares!) to acknowledge the Meſſiah, though they thought ſo reuerently and highly of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, that I may come to the ſecond point, it was neceſſary for our Euangeliſt, after the deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and his office, to adde this prouiſo, that as great as he was, yet no man ſhould take him for <hi>the light.</hi> The Iewes (as we know) were ſtrongly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceited of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: &amp; that, which the Euangeliſt ſaith here of <hi>Iohn,</hi> may ſeeme to nouriſh and ſtrengthen that conceit. For it fals <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Ioa. hom. 4.</note> out often times, that he, whoſe witnes muſt procure cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to another man, is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the party, that ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in need of his teſtimony. Therfore our Sauior tels the Iewes that he regarded not the depoſition of <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor of any <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 34.</note> man, as if it had beene needfull for him. But becauſe they had ſo high an opinion of <hi>Iohn,</hi> therefore he was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their ſakes, to vſe his teſtimony, that they might beleeue. Beſides, it ſerues to ſet out the worth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of our Sauiour, to the Iewes, that <hi>Iohn,</hi> of whom they were ſo well perſwaded, for his greatneſs, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, was but darknes, if he were ſeuered from Chriſt, or compared with him. <hi>He was not the light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, let no man conceiue of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but as of a worthy inſtrument, to bring the Iewes to faith in Chriſt; and as of a holy, and admirable perſon: whoſe whole cariage was ſuch, that hee might haue beene taken for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiah himſelfe; as no ordinarie man poſſibly could bee,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21009:154"/> eſpecially of the learned, and wiſe, among the Iewes. <hi>The people waited</hi> (ſayeth Saint <hi>Luke) and all men muſed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>in their hearts, of</hi> Iohn, <hi>if hee were not the Chriſt:</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, <hi>that Prieſts and Leuites were ſent from the Rulers to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>knowe, if he were not ſo.</hi> Our Euangeliſt therefore hauing (as it was neceſſarie for him) denied him to be the light, repeats that which he had formerly deliuered, touching his office, which was to beare witneſſe of the light. An office of no mean dignity or vſe, to be imploied by God in ſhewing of the Meſſiah, that al might beleeue. We are euerie one of vs readie I doubt not, to cry out with open mouth againſt the in fidelitie, &amp; obſtinacy of the Iewes, who would not bee brought to faith by ſo excellent a miniſtery. Let vs take heede, that wee condemne not our ſelues in that, for which wee reprooue them. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhewed them Chriſt, but in his beginning onely, before he had made any proof of his diuine power, in teachin, and working miracles. We haue the knowledge of all thoſe wonders, and the diſtinct vnderſtanding of the nature, and courſe of his mediatorſhip. Wee haue beene made acquainted with his ſufferings for our ſin, his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant reſurrection, and glorious aſcenſion. And ſhal we neglect ſo many, and ſo worthy points? Nay rather, let vs ſtirre vp our ſelues both to learne, and beleeue, that wee may attaine to the ende of our faith, the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſoules, through our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt: to whome with &amp;c.</p>

Thus hath our Euangeliſt labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſet out to all men, the bounty of the Lord, in ſending ſo glorious a light, to ſhine in the middeſt of darknes; and the vnkindnes, and blindnes of men, that refuſe to bee iulightened. For the diſtribution of theſe 5. verſes by themſelues, wee muſt obſerue, firſt, that the Euangeliſt proceedes to deſcribe the light, Verſe 9. Then he ſheweth the actions thereof, in the later part of the ſame verſe. &amp; the other 4. In the deſcription, the title
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:21009:155"/> 
               <hi>True</hi> is added to the light. The actions of the light, are ſet downe in generall, <hi>It lighteneth euery man, that commeth into the world:</hi> And the manner of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening followes. Where wee conſider, how the light offers it ſelfe. <hi>Hee was in the world; Hee came to his owne.</hi> How is hee entertained; <hi>The world knew him not. His owne receiued him not.</hi> In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the benefit that comes by the light is declared, verſe 12. 13.</p>
            <p>Let vs come now to expound the verſes ſeuerally: and in the 9. wee are firſt to inquire of the tranſlation: then of the diſtribution thereof: Secondly, of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts meaning, and the doctrine it ſelfe. The tranſlation in the former words, <hi>That was the light,</hi> hath two doubts; How wee muſt ſupply that, which in the originall is not expreſt: How the articles therein vſed are to bee tranſlated. The Greeke hath no more ſet downe but <hi>was a light:</hi> The queſtion is, what is heere to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to make the ſentence perfect. One of theſe two things muſt needs bee intended by the Euangeliſt; either hee doth affirme, that there was a true light, though <hi>Iohn</hi> was not the light, or els hee ſhewes vs, which was the true light. If the former pleaſe vs, then wee muſt ſupply that which wants in this ſort, <hi>There was a true light.</hi> But this may well ſeeme needeleſs; becauſe both the Euangeliſt, had auoucht as much before, <hi>That life was the light of men:</hi> and if there had bin no light, or the matter had bin in queſtion, whether there were any light or no, it had bin in vaine for him to haue ſaid, that <hi>Iohn was not the light.</hi> For that ſpeech preſuppoſeth, that <hi>There was a light,</hi> though <hi>Iohn</hi> were not he. It is therfore more likely, or rather certaine, that the holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſhew vs who was the light.</p>
            <p>In this point, our Popiſh <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> agree with vs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer according to their cuſtome, they will needs differ from vs, as far as they can, in tranſlation. Let vs heare
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:21009:156"/> their conceit in tranſlating. <hi>It was the true light.</hi> Why <hi>It?</hi> For neither the originall Greeke, which is the authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call record, nor the vulgar Latin, which they profeſſe to follow, hath any more <hi>It,</hi> then <hi>there.</hi> They had our tranſlation before their face, <hi>That was the true light;</hi> when they deuiſed, how they might diſagree from vs in words at the leaſt, if not in matter. At laſt out comes this new nothing. <hi>It was the light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> What is this ſame <hi>It?</hi> Who knowes not, that in plaine Engliſh, this worde <hi>It</hi> doth not ſo fitly, or fully expreſſe, which was the true light as <hi>that</hi> doth? Let me ſhew you that I ſay, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular applying it to the matter, wee haue in hand. It is agreed vpon, that in the former verſe the Euangeliſt tells vs, <hi>Iohn was not the light, but was ſent to beare witneſſe of the light.</hi> Which then, or who was the light? <hi>It was the light,</hi> ſay our Rhemiſts: who can gheſſe almoſt what they meane? If hee had bin deſcribing of the light, and had affirmed it to bee ſuch, or ſuch, then might this fitly haue bin brought in; <hi>It was the true light.</hi> But nothing beeing in that ſort ſpoken of it, in this part of the Euangeliſts diſcourſe; ſurely it was not fit, to giue vs knowledge of his true meaning, in this place.</p>
            <p>This will better appeare by comparing our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this affectation of theirs. <hi>That</hi> (ſay wee) <hi>was the true light.</hi> Would you know which <hi>that?</hi> That light, of which <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſent to beare witnes, was the true light. Who doth not eaſily conceiue this? Shall wee tranſlate as our Engliſh Papiſts doe; <hi>It was the true light?</hi> Expreſſe that you ſay, like a Grammarian. Muſt you not be driuen to this, <hi>It light, of which Iohn, &amp;c.</hi> Make the beſt of it you poſſibly can, and you muſt bee forced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>It,</hi> by <hi>That light. It was,</hi> that is, <hi>That light was.</hi> See, ſee, whither a contentious deſire of diſſenting from vs, hath drawne you as it were by the neck, againſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and common ſenſe. You will ſay perhaps; It is a
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:21009:156"/> ſmall matter, about which I make this a doe againſt them. Bee it ſo. And yet I diſcerne not, how it ſhould bee counted a thing of ſmall importance, to make the word of God without any good ſenſe, by a falſe tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But let it bee as ſmall a matter as you will. What is it to affect, and ſeeke out ſuch a manner of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, where the truth is manifeſt vnto them, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reiected by them? It will not ſerue the turne to ſay, as ſome Papiſts doe without conſcience, or ciuill equitie; It is the tranſlation or expoſition of Heretikes; <note place="margin">Maldon in Ioa. 1. 1</note> therefore I will not like it; as if the men, and not the matter were to be regarded. I muſt needs confeſſe, that when I firſt lookt vpon this <hi>Elephants</hi> calfe, that was ſo long a breeding, I wondred in my ſelfe, what ſo ſtrange a ſhape ſhould portend. But when I had taken a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better view of it, I perceiued the crafty purpoſe of the damme in ſo monſtrous a birth. It is a principle in Poperie, that <hi>the Scriptures</hi> are not to bee read of the common Lay people, as they call them. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerthrowne by the force of the truth in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, when they ſaw there was no remedy, but they muſt of neceſſitie affoord their poore ſeduced follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſome tranſlation of the Bible, they thought, they would ſo handle the matter, that they ſhould bee little the better for it. Therefore haue they ſo tranſlated the new Teſtament, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is ſaid to haue ſet out ſome of his bookes, as if hee had not ſet them out at all: <note place="margin">Ariſt in opiſt. ad Alex.</note> Becauſe they were ſo hard to bee vnderſtood of any, but his owne Schollers. Yet his dealing was farre hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then theſe mens, who haue laboured for nothing more, then to make ſuch a tranſlation, as for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and vnpleaſantneſs thereof, might driue all men from the reading and ſtudying of it. If this cenſure ſeeme vncharitable, or vnciuill to any man, let mee intreate him to ſuſpend his iudgement, till he haue ſeene what I can, and will, if it pleaſe God, diſcouer in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21009:157"/> of this Goſpell, touching their courſe in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>Wee vnderſtand what ſupply is to be made by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of that, which in the Originall might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed better, then in our Engliſh. Now to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: Which are two, or rather, one twice repeated. For the Text lies thus; <hi>The light, the true.</hi> It is indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certaine; that the vſe of Articles in the Greek is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vncertaine; as I ſhewed at the firſt verſe. Yet haue wee two reaſons, why wee ſhoulde looke for ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall ſignification of it, in this place. Firſt wee ſee, that in the next verſe before, it is of neceſſarie vſe. <hi>Hee was not the light.</hi> Take away the Article, and reade it thus; <hi>Hee was not light, or a light.</hi> This were to <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 35.</note> affirme a direct vntruth, contrarie to the Scriptures. For <hi>Iohn</hi> (as our Sauiour himſelfe hath teſtified of him) was a burning and a ſhining candle. Therefore muſt wee ſo conceiue the Euangeliſt, that hee denies him to haue bin <hi>The light, not a light, or light.</hi> Secondly, the doubling of the Article, and applying it both to the Subſtantiue <hi>light,</hi> and the Adiectiue <hi>true</hi> (whereas vſually it belongs onely to the former, in the nature of the tongue, and practiſe of the Scripture) notes vnto vs ſome thing more then ordinarie of that kinde, <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> whereof there is ſpeech. <hi>This is that my Sonne, that belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedone.</hi> If the Article had bin left out in the later word, any ſonne might haue bin ſignified by that voice from heauen, for ought the words neceſſarily imported. But the repeating of it, ties it as it were to the Perſon of our Sauiour Chriſt, who was the onely naturall ſonne of God his father. And this is ſo much the more to bee conſidered, becauſe it is very rare in the Scripture to find examples of it. Well then; How ſhall wee tranſlate it? <hi>That was the light, the true light.</hi> Theſe words expreſſe the Euangeliſts ſenſe to the full, &amp; yet leaue the Greek text vnblemiſhed, by putting the firſt, and laſt words in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21009:157"/> letter from the reſt, as it is well obſerued in our common tranſlation, that euery man may know what is in the Originall, and what is added to ſet forth the holy Ghoſts meaning, according to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſeuerall tongues, into which the <hi>Hebrew, and Greeke</hi> are turned, for the peoples vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>But of the tranſlation in this former part of the verſe, enough: that, which I haue to ſay concerning the later part, I thinke beſt to reſerue, till I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the diſtribution of the whole, and come to the ſeuerall handling of that clauſe by it ſelfe. In ſeeking out the diſtribution, I doe not inquire, into how many parcels, or members, the matter of it is to bee diuided, which is commonly ſignified by that tearme <hi>diſtribution;</hi> but I am to ſearch firſt, whether the whole verſe be one propoſition, or ſentence: or els two. In the firſt verſe, to make that I ſay, plaine, we had three ſeuerall propoſitions. 1 <hi>The Worde was in the beginning: 2. the Worde was with GOD: 3. the Worde was GOD:</hi> The ſecond verſe contained but one, <hi>The ſame Worde was in the beginning with GOD.</hi> For although there bee, at the leaſt two diuers points in that ſentence: <hi>(The Worde was in the beginning; and the Worde was GOD)</hi> yet they are compriſed in one propoſition. So are they alſo in this verſe, which I now expound, <hi>That was the true light; the light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth euery man, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into the world.</hi> Yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe two make but one propoſition in the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts writing. If any man bee deſirous to know, why I caſt this doubt here, rather then in any of the former verſes, all which in a manner haue more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences then one; hee is to vnderſtand, that none of them, afforded the like cauſe of doubting; euery one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſeuerall propoſitions ſo diſtinct, that they could not well bee tied altogether in one. But heere the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21009:158"/> caſe is otherwiſe, as you ſhall preſently ſee. For thoſe wordes in the later part, which haue a full ſenſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, may notwithſtanding reaſonably ſeeme to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the former part, and to make vp <hi>the Antecedent</hi> or <hi>Subiect</hi> of the ſentence: Beare with mee I pray you a little in theſe tearmes; I avoide them, all I can: and now I am forced to vſe them, I will doe my beſt to make you vnderſtand them. Euery ſentence, or propoſition hath ſomething as the ground, and matter, ſome other thing as an appurtenance to that; which is eyther af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or denied of it. As in the firſt verſe: <hi>The Words</hi> is the cheefe matter; that which is auoucht of the worde is, that <hi>hee was GOD.</hi> The worde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that ſentence is the Antecedent, or Subiect; GOD is the Conſequent, Attribute or Predicate. Let me not trouble you too much with theſe words of Art; but rather apply them as ſhortly as I can to the matter I haue in hand.</p>
            <p>How this verſe may well conſiſt of two diuers ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and what they are, I ſignified before. Let mee ſhew now in what ſort they may bee ſhut vp, both in one: which may thus be done. <hi>That light which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth euery man that commeth into the world, was the light, the true light.</hi> The Antecedent or Subiect is <hi>The light, which inlighteneth euery man, &amp;c.</hi> Of this light it is affirmed, that <hi>it was the true light.</hi> Both the words will beare this diſpoſing of the verſe, and the ſenſe will bee good, and fit; yea I may ſay more: The ſpeech of the Euangeliſt may ſeeme, more perfect in it ſelfe, and to haue leſſe neede of any ſupply, if wee ſo vnderſtand it. For both the Greeke, and the Engliſh may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, and eaſily bee conceiued, if wee ſo reade, and expound the verſe, without the expreſſe adding of any oher worde, but <hi>That,</hi> in the Engliſh: The Greeke needes abſolutely none at all. Yet I rather chooſe to diuide the verſe into two diſtinct propoſitions; partly for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:21009:158"/> the conſent of all interpreters of it, which I haue reade; but eſpecially, becauſe beeing ſo diuided, it ſeemes to depend better vpon that, which went before. <hi>That light of which Iohn came to beare witneſſe was the true light: Which light alſo inlighteneth euery man, that commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world</hi> If any man liſt to take it the other way, he may ſhew the agreement of it, with the former, in this ſort. <hi>Iohn was not the light: That light which inlighteneth euery man, &amp;c. was the true light:</hi> Now this light is CHRIST, as the Euangeliſt had ſaid, verſe 4. <hi>That was the light of men.</hi> But the other interpretation ioines ſomewhat more cloſe to the later part of the verſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately before; <hi>But was ſent to beare witnes of the light. That light was the true light, &amp;c.</hi> The verſe then hath two ſeuerall propoſitions, or ſentences, to bee handled ſeuerally, each by it ſelfe. <hi>That was the light, the true light.</hi> Firſt of the words what is meant by <hi>True:</hi> What the Article being doubled imports. Then of the Euangeliſts meaning, and the Doctrine of the place. Truth in the Scripture is commonly taken, as the nature of the worde requires for that which is contrary to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood. <hi>Caſt off lying</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and let euery one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 25.</note> 
               <hi>ſpeake truth to his neighbour.</hi> Sometimes it is put for that, which is oppoſite to the ſhadowes of the Lawe. <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh 1 17.</note> 
               <hi>lawe was giuen by Moſes, but grace, and truth came by IESVS CHRIST.</hi> And this ſenſe hath alſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the vſe of the worde, in common ſpeech; where the patterne, or a thing it ſelfe, that is inuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or counterfetted is called the Truth. <hi>The truth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vritas vincit iantationem.</note> 
               <hi>excelleth the imitation.</hi> So the Lord is named <hi>the true God: This is euerlaſting life to know thee, the onely true God.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh 17. 3.</note> Some thinke that by this truth, or trueneſs, the light is ſignified to bee ſuch by nature, and of it ſelfe, not by <note place="margin">Ciril. in Ioa. lib. 1. cap. 9.</note> grace, or participation. And ſo may the Lord bee called <hi>the true beeing:</hi> becauſe he is ſo naturally, and imparts to all things ſuch being, as they haue. But of this ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:21009:159"/> I thinke there is no example to bee found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure. The two former agree very well to our Sauiour, who is indeede the true light, without any darkneſs of error, or falſhood in him. <hi>Hee whom God hath ſent, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the words of God; for God giueth him not the ſpirit by meaſure.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 34.</note> And of him were all the ceremonies of the lawe, ſhadowes, and figures; as the Apoſtle hath ſhewed at large in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes; eſpecially in the ninth and tenth Chapters.</p>
            <p>But the beſt way to vnderſtand the true ſenſe of the worde; is to compare it with other of the ſame kinde, in the Scripture. For which purpoſe what ſhall wee neede to goe any farder, then this Goſpell? Wherein wee haue two like ſpeeches, vttered by our Sauiour, of himſelfe. <hi>My father</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>giueth you the true</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 32.</note> 
               <hi>bread from Heauen.</hi> What true bread was this? It is euident, that hee ſpeaketh it of himſelfe, whom a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before hee had called <hi>the meate that indureth to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe 27.</note> 
               <hi>life.</hi> Heere he compares himſelfe with that <hi>Manna,</hi> whereof the Iewes boaſted, and wherewith they ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> fed them, euen with bread from Heauen. To this our Sauiour anſwereth; that <hi>Moſes gaue them not bread from heauen: but my father giueth you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the true bread from Heauen.</hi> They had bread from heauen, by the miniſterie of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they proued by the place <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 24.</note> of the Pſalme. <hi>He gaue them bread from heauen.</hi> How then ſaith our Sauiour, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue them not bread from heauen, and that his father giues them the true bread? Surely, that bread, which they had by the meanes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was true bread, and did truely the office of bread, to feed their bodies. What then? Doth he meane, that it was but a figure of the heauenly bread which God was to giue, and now in, and by him, did giue them? This was true indeede; but not ſo much to purpoſe, as our Sauiours ſpeech was, beeing rightly vnderſtood. Hee <note place="margin">Ver. 27.</note> had perſwaded them before, <hi>to labour for the meat, that</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:21009:159"/> 
               <hi>endureth to euerlaſting life.</hi> They would needes haue <note place="margin">Ver. 30. Ver. 31.</note> him ſhew them ſome ſigne, that is, worke ſome mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whereby they might be occaſioned to beleeue him, that there was better bread, then ſuch as their fathers had eaten in the Wildernes. To this our Lord anſweres, that <hi>Moſes gaue them not bread from heauen,</hi> namely no ſuch <note place="margin">Ver. 32.</note> bread, as could endure, to life eternall. That bread, that could ſo feede them, was the true bread, and was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his father; in compariſon whereof, the other was not worthy the name of bread. The vſe of the bread is to nouriſn, and continue life: and that bread which can not worke ſuch an effect in him, that eates it, is not true bread. <hi>Your fathers</hi> (ſaith he afterward) <hi>dideate Manna in the Wildernes and are dead.</hi> How <note place="margin">Ver. 49. Ver. 50.</note> then was that true bread? <hi>This is the bread that came downe from heauen, that hee which eateth of it, ſhould not die.</hi> Loe: heere we haue the true bread, which performes that in truth to the ſoule, that the other doth but as it were offer to the body. Therefore alſo he tells them a lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle after, <hi>that his fleſh is truely meate, and his bloud truly</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver 55.</note> 
               <hi>drink.</hi> A like place we haue in the ſame Goſpell, where he tearmes himſelfe the true Vine. <hi>I am the true Vine.</hi> Why is <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 1.</note> he the true Vine? Becauſe hee doth indeede truely, and effectually nouriſh, comfort, &amp; ſuſteine thoſe, that cleaue to him by faith; whereas the beſt Vine in the world, hath ſomtimes dead branches, and at the laſt dieth it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now then if any man demaund in what ſenſe Chriſt is the true light; in the very ſame (ſay I) in which hee doth affirme, that he is <hi>the true bread,</hi> and <hi>the true Vine.</hi> The Sonne, which is the fountaine of this viſible light, doth not ſo truely ſhine, and giue light to the eyes of the body, as Ieſus Chriſt, doth inlighten the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which is the eye of the Soule. Ieſus Chriſt? (may <note place="margin">Ambroſ. de fide contra Arian. cap. 3.</note> ſome man ſay.) Why not rather God the Father; or, at leaſt, the whole Trinitie? whoſe ioint action it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, and not the Sonnes alone. Theſe obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:21009:160"/> are eaſily anſwered. For it is more then plame, that our Euangeliſt ſpeakes only of the Sonne, in this whole deſcription. What reaſon is there then, to vnderſtand this one verſe of any other, but of him alone? How ſhould this point, applied either to the Father, or to the Trinitie, haue any due place in this diſcourſe? Is it not alſo apparent, that the light here ſpoken of, is the ſame, whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> bare witneſs; and which is ſaid, in the verſes following, to haue come vnto his owne, and to haue giuen the priuiledge to men, of becomming the ſonnes of God? Conſider yet farder, how vnfit it had bin for Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> hauing called <hi>the Worde</hi> by the name of <hi>the light,</hi> in the former verſes, here, vpon a ſodaine, to giue the ſame title to any other of the perſons, or the Godhead. Will any man take the worde in ſuch diuers ſort, if hee bee not conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe ſo, by cleere euidence of the Text? But ſo to vnderſtand it, were to couer the place with darkneſſe, not to make the ſenſe of it cleere, and euident. But the action of inlightening is common to all three Perſons. So are all actions of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the three which concerne any other, beſide the Perſons themſelues. <hi>To chooſe, to iuſtifie, to ſanctifie, to redeeme, to inſtruct, to inſpire, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, &amp;c.</hi> are all common workes of the Diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Yet are they appropriated, in the Scripture, ſeuerally to the ſeuerall perſons, as all men know, and as I muſt ſhew particularly, when I come to the 33. verſe</p>
            <p>In the meane while, let vs goe forward with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this verſe; wherein we are next to conſider, what the doubling of the article may teach vs. <hi>The light; the true light:</hi> was it not enough to haue ſaid <hi>The light?</hi> For ſurely that implies an eſpeciall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the light, wee meane. There bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many candles, torches, ſtarres, and moones: but the ſunne onely is <hi>the light.</hi> They are lights,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:21009:160"/> but not <hi>the light.</hi> If that would not ſerue the turne, hee might haue ſaid, <hi>The true light;</hi> then which, what can bee ſaid more? All this contented not the holy Ghoſt: but that he might rauiſh vs with the loue, and admiration of this light, hee calls it <hi>The light, the true light.</hi> Some apply it more particularly, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eciſely to our Sauiour, in theſe two conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>The light</hi> (ſay they) with an Article. to note the excellencie of the Perſon; <hi>The true light,</hi> with the ſame Article repeated, to ſignifie the glorie and brightneſs of that knowledge, which flowes to men from that light. I deny not, but the Euangeliſt comprizeth both vnder theſe wordes. I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee intended to giue vs notice of them ſo diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the repetition of the Article, or no.</p>
            <p>It remaines, that I deliuer the plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Euangeliſt, and declare the Doctrine conteyned in it. Wherein I may, and will bee the ſhorter, becauſe ſomwhat hath bin ſaid already of each, in examining the former points. What then meanes Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> by theſe wordes; <hi>That was the light; &amp;c.</hi> Hee had told vs in the laſt verſe, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was not the light, but was ſent before, as a ſeruant, to giue notice, and to beare witneſs of the light. Now hee proceedes to ſhew vs the excellencie of that light; in reſpect of whom, <hi>Iohn,</hi> though hee were of ſo rare giftes, and highe account was no body. Looke vpon the Moone in the night time, when ſhee is at the full, and you would thinke, you had light enough. Surely hee, that had neuer ſeene the Sunne, would eaſily bee perſwaded, to take the Moone for the Well, or ſpring of light. But if hee ſhould once come to ſee the beauty, and brightneſs of the ſunne, hee would be aſhamed of his former childiſhneſs, and ignorance,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:21009:161"/> that thought that to bee all, which in a manner, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine is as plaine, and was handled more largely, at the 4. and 5. verſes. CHRIST is the true light. There are candles and torches here on earth; men that haue diſcouered ſome truth concerning God. There are Starres, and Moones ſhining from heauen: Such as, by ſupernaturall illumination, haue reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many, and great myſteries, concerning our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and ſaluation by IESVS CHRIST. But all theſe are nothing to him. If it were poſſible to ioine all the lights, I ſpake of, together; would they match the brightnes of the ſunne? How much leſſe can theſe torches, and ſtarres, which haue all their light, from the Sonne of God, equall the autor, and giuer of that light? Let the light, they giue, bee as great, as it can reaſonably bee imagined to bee, yet are they not <hi>the true light.</hi> what doe wee then gazing, and gaping vpon Men, as if there were no light, but in them? If any man haue a little more knowledge, then others, that hee can teach vs ſomewhat, which euerie one is not acquainted withall, wee wonder at him, as the onely light: Yea, wee are oftentimes ſo carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a conceite of his brightneſs, that the light it ſelfe is either deſpiſed or forgotten in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him. It was ſomwhat more excuſable in the Iewes (though it were intollerable) to preferre <hi>Iohn</hi> before CHRIST; becauſe they had ſettled a reuerend opinion of him in their hearts, when they had no thought of any other Meſſiah: But how ſhall wee bee excuſed, that know who is the light, and yet dote vpon other ſo much, that wee hardly thinke on him? Hee, that fits our humour, either with ſome point of Diuinitie, which wee knew not, or with ſome worde of exhortation, that wee deſired, is ſo admired, and followed, that wee are ready to receiue
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:21009:161"/> any thing, hee will deliuer vnto vs for truth, without viewing it by the true light. I ſpeake not this to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <hi>Iohn,</hi> but to magnifie Chriſt. <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>a light,</hi> but not <hi>the light.</hi> To ſpeake truely, and plainely, <hi>Iohn</hi> was no light at all; as our Euangeliſt affirmed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe. Hee was a candleſtick, or a torch-bearer, to holde out, and ſhew the light; but, the light hee was not. Hee gliſtered in the eyes of men, as a peece of glaſſe, or any burniſht metall doth, vpon which the ſunne, or ſome other light beates, which is not ſeene of vs, but by reflexion, at the ſecond hand. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; that which the Euangeliſt ſaith here of our Sauiour, is the very ſame, that the Baptiſt woulde teach his diſciples, whome hee ſent to Ieſus, ſaying; <hi>Art thou he, that ſhould come, or ſhall we looke for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Iohn</hi> knew well enough, that Ieſus was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, as hee teſtified at the time of his baptiſme, and <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 2. 3.</note> afterward: but his Schollers were not ſo perſwaded. Therefore hee ſends them on ſuch a meſſage, that they might themſelues diſcerne him to bee the light. This is that, which the Apoſtles auouched, after his death, that <hi>There is no other name vnder heauen, by which we</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>can be ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miſerable then, and damnable is the caſe of thoſe men, who for any benefit, and commoditie in this world, or for any paine, and torment, that can be here indured, for a time, renounce the Sauiour of their ſoules, and light of eternall life, Ieſus Chriſt. Doe you maruell brethren, what ſhould make me breake out into ſuch a ſpeech, in this Auditorie? All of vs profeſſe beleefe in Chriſt; we haue all bin baptized; wee haue all bin taught. Put caſe wee did all beleeue indeede, for the perſwaſion of the truth, wee now maintaine, as wee haue bin taught; were it therefore needeleſs to vſe any word of exhortation, to confirme vs in the truth? Is not our Faith nouriſht, and ſtrengthened in vs, by
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:21009:162"/> the ſame meanes, by which it is begotten? I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our naturall ignorance, which had neede of much teaching. I let paſſe our ſhuttle memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which eaſily forget that, wee haue learned. Let mee omitt our vnruly affections, which draw vs away from the meditation of thoſe things, that concerne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>Shall I tell you in one worde, why I haue entred into this courſe, vpon a point ſo well knowne, and generally reſolued of? Did none of you euer heare of any Chriſtians, of any Eugliſhmen, that haue denied the faith of CHRIST, and become <hi>Renegados?</hi> I muſt needes confeſſe, I ſpeake vpon report, not vpon ſight, or experience; but yet vpon ſuch report as I haue good cauſe to credit, both for the honeſtie, and the number of the reporters. It hath come to paſſe (my heart bleeds within mee to thinke, and vtter it) yea it doth fall out daily, a great deale too often, that men trained vp here amongſt vs in the religion of IESVS CHRIST, for ſome worldly reſpects, without conſcience of their profeſſion, without care of their ſoules, without regard of their credits, without feare of damnation, haue blaſphemed the Lord IESVS CHRIST, that died for them, and turned Turkes. O the weakneſs of our faith! O the ſtrength of our corruption! O the hypocriſie of our hearts! That, which happeneth to one man, may happen to any man. Doeſt thou beleeue? So they ſaid, and (like enough) thought too. But thou art ſtrong in faith. Who (almoſt) thinkes himſelfe weake? The pride of our nature doth ſo puffe vs vp, with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of our owne knowledge, and beliefe, that the eies of our mindes are cloſed, and our ſight dimmed, if not blinded, that wee are not able to giue any true iudgement (naturally) of our greateſt imperfections. Feare makes vs wary, leaſt wee ſhoulde fall. Hope
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:21009:162"/> fils vs with preſumption, that wee run headlong to our fall.</p>
            <p>Be not high minded, but feare: Feare thine owne corruption: ſuſpect thine owne ſtrength. Thy ſtrength ſay d I? nay, thy weakenes rather. If thou wilt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume vpon Gods powerfull mercy to vphold thee; lay hold vpon the meanes, hee hath appointed for the ſtaying of thee vp. Beleeue, remember, reſolue, that Chriſt onely is the light. I am not to enter into any diſcourſe, whereby I may inſtruct, or direct thee how to confirme thy faith in this point; but onely to exhort thee thereunto, according as this doctrine giues me iuſt occaſion.</p>
            <p>It is not vnlikely, that there are ſome in this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, perhappes (as in ſuch a ſmall company) not a few, whome theſe thinges may neerely concerne: Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; a good part of whoſe eſtate lyes abroade in Turkey or Barbarie. Maryners, whoſe courſe of life, and helpe of maintenance, requires imployment in thoſe parts. Trauaylers, whoſe deſire to ſee faſhions, and learne experience, will draw them into all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and companies. Young impes, who becomming apprentices, ſhall bee tranſported out of this nuiſerie, where they haue beene bred, to bee planted in thoſe places for many yeeres, euen for the chief time of their growthe. Shall I craue leaue of you, to ſpeake a few wordes to the point in hand, with your fauour and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention? I will not aske you, whether you beleeue that the Scripture, contayned in the olde, and newe Teſtament, bee the worde of God or no. I knowe you beleeue it. As needleſſe is it, yea perhappes more needleſſe, to tell you, that this Scripture (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worde of GOD) is of certaine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, both for the whole, and euerie part of it. Let vs come more particularly to the matter, wee are now in handling. The holy Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:21009:163"/> inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, affirmes, vpon the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that inſpiration, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, is the light. Of the trueth heereof thou profeſleſt, thou art reſolued. With this reſolution (as thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeſt thy ſelfe) thou ſayleſt, as thy occaſions call thee, into Heathen Countries, where Chriſt, and this truth, concerning him, is not onely doubted of, but denyed, hated, impugned, perſecuted. It falles out, while thou art there, that either thine owne miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor, in the carriage of thy perſon, or managing of thy buſineſſe, caſts thee into ſome daunger: or the opportunitie of ſome pleaſure, profite, or honour bewitcheth thee with an earneſt deſire thereof. There is no meanes for thee to auoyde that daunger, or to enioy thoſe benefittes, but to diſclayme Ieſus Chriſt, and to embrace Mahomet. Now ſhewe thy faith; now make proofe of thy conſtancie: nowe it muſt, and will bee ſeene, whether thy profeſſion bee ſincere, or counterfaite.

            <p>But thou haſt ſomewhat, perhappes, to ſay for thy ſelfe in this caſe. Let vs giue thee the hearing: ſpeake thy minde freely, and ſpare not. Well; I ſee what thou wouldeſt ſay: that if thou perſeuer in acknowledging Chriſt to bee the light, thou ſhalt bee ſure to bee clapt in priſon, and to bee depriued of the light of this worlde: but if thou honour Mahomet, as the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of truth from God, thou ſhalt ſhine in the glory of this life. Is this all? Alas poore wretch; what ſhall it auayle thee, to eſcape a few yeeres impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, and to bee ſhutte vppe, for it, in the Dungeon of hell, world without ende? What art thou the better, for a little painted glorie, and traſh in this life, when thereby thou ſhalt loſe the glorie of God in the life to come? Art thou afrayde of a darke priſon; and dooſt not tremble at the horror of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh darkeneſſe? why dooſt thou not conſider, that Chriſt is the light? Can hee bee in darkeneſſe, that hath the light with him, and ſhining to him? Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, nor diſcomforted. This light ſhall ſhewe the more, in that darke Iayle, thou feareſt, then the Sunne canne doe, at the noone day, in the open fieldes. As for the ſhadow of glorie, thou ſo doateſt vpon, what is it to the light of truth? Say thou wert Emperour of Turkey, or didſt commaunde the whole Worlde; without this light thou wert couered with more then Aegyptian darkeneſſe. What canſt thou hope for by Mahomet, when all hee coulde deuiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is nothing but a little ſenſuall, and beaſtly voluptuouſneſſe; the happineſſe of a Goate, a Swine, or a Dogge, and not of a man? They doe all they can to turne themſelues into Beaſts, that feede their brutiſh humour, with the conceit of ſuch filthy pleaſures.</p>
            <p>How blind muſt they needes be, that embrace dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for light? There was ſom ſhew for the error of the Iewes. The Turkes haue not the leaſt colour for beleefe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:21009:164"/> in Mahomet: except a fewe knackes of couſinage, which ſome fooles tooke for miracles. The Alcoran, wherin the light of his knowledge ſhould ſhine, is ſuch a diſorderly bundle of ſenſeleſſe dreames, and idle tales without head or foote, that a man of any reaſon cannot read, or heare it with patience. But the true light powreth foorth ſtreames of admirable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for the inlightning of all men, that they may, ſee the truth of God to ſaluation. So it followeth in my text: which <hi>inlightneth euerie man that commeth into the world.</hi> This is the other propoſition or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in which (as in the former) Firſt, of the words, then of the Euangeliſts meaning. In the words I finde ſome occaſion of doubt, concerning the tranſlation: of which I wonder that our Rhemiſts tooke not hold, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo faire an opportunitie.

               <hi>comming.</hi> And the Latine, which the Rhemiſts profeſſe to followe, with ſuperſtitious preciſeneſſe, hath expreſt it by a worde of the ſame kinde, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification: How chance our newe Tranſlaters, hauing an Engliſh word ſo fit for the purpoſe, yea fitter for the Greeke then their Latine is, and fully expreſſing the Latine, did not remember to make their aduantage of it? Doubtleſſe, they neuer markt it; For if they had, it is apparant by their ordinarie practiſe, that they would haue vſed it; eſpecially, ſeeing it differs from our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, &amp; affords a double interpretation, as the Greek doth.</p>
            <p>There are two thinges mentioned in this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that which inlightneth, and that, which is inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the light, and man. The word <hi>comming,</hi> in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is ſuch, that it may well agree either with the light, or with man. To the light it may thus bee ioyned; <hi>which light comming into the worlde, inlightneth euerie man.</hi> If wee referre it to man, wee may tranſlate it
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:21009:164"/> thus, <hi>which inlightneth euerie man comming into the world,</hi> or that <hi>commeth into the world.</hi> I will not ſtriue much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſo ſmall a matter; yet (to ſpeake my minde plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) I hold that word for the better, which comes neerer to the originall, and hath alſo example from the Latin. Onely there ſeemes to bee this inconuenience, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the Greek, and tranſlation of the word <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> that wee ſhall bee thought to reſtrain this inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the time of a mans birth, or comming into the world. For, ſo much the wordes ordinarily import. <hi>Which inlightneth euerie man comming into the world:</hi> that is, <hi>euerie man when hee comes into the world.</hi> And then cannot this bee vnderſtood of ſupernaturall grace, and teaching by reuelation: but of the light of nature; whereas the holy Ghoſt, in this place, ſpeakes onely of the former: as I ſhewed at the fourth verſe. Yet the Greeke and Latine are both ſubiect to the like incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, and the Engliſh may bee otherwiſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; to ſignifie no more, then the common tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>that commeth.</hi> It is ſomewhat to haue warrant from the Greeke, and conſent of the Latine, though it bee not altogether ſo plaine, as perhappes otherwiſe it might bee. The Rhemiſts haue reiected both. But in the next words they haue followed the Latine, and left both vs and the Greeke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The world,</hi> ſayeth our tranſlation, according to the <note place="margin">

For <hi>this world,</hi> and <hi>the world,</hi> in euerie mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſignifie the ſame thing. But who had not rather drinke of the Fountaine, then of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, though the water bee pure, and ſweete in both?</p>
            <p>But of the tranſlation enough: now a worde or two of the Euangeliſtes manner of ſpeech: <hi>Euerie man, that commeth into the world.</hi> Why did not Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:21009:165"/> content himſelfe to ſay <hi>Euerie man,</hi> but addeth, that <hi>commeth into the world.</hi> Shall wee imagine, as ſome haue done very ſtrangely, that the ſoules of men were created at the firſt altogether by God, and are reſerued by him, to bee coupled to bodies, according to their <note place="margin">Origen. de princip. lib. 1. cap. 3 &amp; lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> behauiour, good, or badde, in that world, where they were created? This idle fancy, and fonde error is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht long ſince, that it were loſt labour to ſpend anic time in the refuting of it.</p>
            <p>There is another opinion, in it ſelfe true, but not fitte for this text; that therefore men are thus deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, becauſe the ſoules, though they haue not anie beeing with God, before the creation, or making of the bodies, to which they are to bee ioyned; yet they may bee ſayde to come into the worlde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not framed of any matter, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are; but haue their originall immediately, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their ſubſtance, from God himſelfe: whereas the bodies ſo come into the world, that they are faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and formed heere belowe of an earthly matter. But this ſeemes to be ouer-curious, and nothing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell, which enters not into ſuch opinions, as little concerne our knowledge, in any point of Religion.</p>
            <p>What is then the meaning of this ſpeech, <hi>That commeth into the world?</hi> Surely, nothing elſe, but <hi>that is borne;</hi> and ſo it is often vſed in the Scripture, as the contrarie, <hi>to goe out of the worlde, is to die. Naked came I out of my mothers womhe</hi> (ſayeth <hi>Iob) and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall I returne thither againe. To come out of the wombe, is to bee borne: toreturne,</hi> that is, to goe out of the world, or to leaue it, is <hi>to die.</hi> The ſame kinde of ſpeech, the wiſe King vſeth: <hi>As Hee came foorth of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>his mothers belly, hee ſhall returne naked to goe as hee came.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe, adde that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Wee brought</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:21009:165"/> 
               <hi>nothing into this world, and it is certaine wee ſhall carrie</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>nothing out. VVee brought nothing:</hi> namely, when by our birth wee came into the worlde; <hi>VVee ſhall carrie nothing out,</hi> when wee dye. This bringing, and carrying away, argues a comming, and a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But why woulde the Euangeliſt ſo deſcribe men? I am wholly of their opinion in this point, who thinke that hee followed the <hi>Hebrewe Rabbins</hi> herein, who doo oftentimes call a man by the like name; vnder which they comprehend infants too, none excepted.</p>
            <p>This manner of ſpeech it is likely the common people had learned of their teachers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by it Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would farther teach them, that CHRIST is hee, which inlightneth all men, one, and other, that no man may except himſelfe. Some expound this comming into the worlde, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation by baptiſme. By what warrant? where is it euer ſo called in Scripture? Howe canne it bee ſo tearmed? Baptiſme rather carries out of the world, then brings vs into it. For in, and by Baptiſme wee renounce the world, and dye vnto it; ſo farre are wee from comming into it thereby. It is therefore beſt, and ſafeſt, to take the wordes in the playneſt ſenſe, and to vnderſtande by them, <hi>To bee borne,</hi> which is common to all men whatſoeuer: ſo much the rather, becauſe our Lorde in the Goſpell hath a like ſpeech, by which hee notes all men. <hi>Among them,</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>which are borne of VVoemen, aroſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 11.</note> 
               <hi>there not a greater then</hi> Iohn <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> Is this any more, then if hee had ſayd, <hi>Among men, there is not a greater then</hi> Iohn?</p>
            <p>Hauing thus cleered thoſe doubtes, which, by reaſon of the wordes, might make the Euangeliſtes meaning more darke, and hard; Let vs come now
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21009:166"/> to the matter, that is heere deliuerd. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parte of the verſe, our Lorde was ſayde to bee <hi>the true light;</hi> in this later propoſition, hee is ſhewed to bee ſo, by an eſpeciall effect, which is inlightning euery man. Is euerie man then inlightned? How elſe, if our Sauiour inlighten euerie man? But there are many, not men only, but nations, that neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any light of the Goſpell, or inlightning from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This doubt hath made diuers writers expound this place of the light of nature, which wee haue by creation. And this, it is apparant, wee haue of Chriſt, <hi>By whome all thinges were made, who is the life of men.</hi> But what reaſon ſhould leade vs, to apply this to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light? ſeeing wee haue made it manifeſt, that in the former verſes, it is to bee vnderſtoode of that, which is ſupernaturall. Why ſhould wee giue the worde <hi>light,</hi> ſuch a ſignification heere, as it hath no where elſe, in all the Scripture? But it is no where vſed for the light of reaſon, which wee haue by nature; nor for that generall knowledge of GOD, which wee partly bring with vs into the world, and partly attaine to, by the contemplation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Wherefore wee muſt needes conceiue, that the Euangeliſt ſpeakes of that lights which men receiue by Reuelation from GOD, concerning the meanes of euerlaſting life, by faith in Chriſt; of which the greateſt part of the worlde neuer had any notice. It behooues vs then to conſider the poynt with good aduiſe, that wee may vnderſtande the Euangeliſts meaning aright; and neither deny, that our Sauiour inlightneth euerie man, nor confeſſe that euerie man is inlightned with the knowledge of him to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>The auncient Diuines of former ages, ſeeing
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:21009:166"/> theſe inconveniences, and deſiring to prouide ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rredy for them; by their meditation, and learning, did find out, and leaue vnto vs 2 eſpſeciall anſwers, for the ſatiſfying of theſe doubts. Firſt they teach vs, that Chriſt <note place="margin">Aug. Enchirid ad Laurent. cap. 103 De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peccat. merit. 8 remiſſ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 1. c. 25</note> may truely be ſaid to enlighten euery man, becauſe no man is inlightned, but by him. If there were but one Phyſician, or one Schoolemaſter in this Citty, of that one it might truly be affirmed, that he taught all, that he cured all. This is he (might we ſay) that cureth euery man: This is he, that teacheth euery one. Not meaning thereby, that euery particular man, woman, and childe, in the Citty, is taught or healed; but ſignifying in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that there is no other Phyſician, no other teacher, by which any one receiues health, or inſtruction. So our Sauiour Chriſt may be conceiu'd to inlighten euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; becauſe euery one that is inlightned, hath that light from him; and not becauſe euery one is inlightned. So that Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> meaning, according to this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be thus vnderſtood; <hi>Ieſus, of whome Iohn bare witneſſe, was the true light: and whoſoeuer is inlightned, is inlightned by him.</hi> This expoſition, as euery man may eaſily diſcerne, agreeth very fitly with the former part, and proueth it very ſtrongly. For indeed what ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proofe can we require, to aſſure vs, that our Lorde was the true light, then that euery man fetcheth all the light, he hath, from him? Either we muſt grant, that no man at all hath any light of grace; or elſe yeeld, that he, from whom he hath that light, is the true light. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is not doubted of; How then ſhoulde the later bee in queſtion? The ſecond anſwere doth not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the partyes inlightned, as him, that doth inlighten; who ſhineth to euery man, that will open his eies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him. For as the naturall light, ſpreadeth the beames thereof abroad, in al places, and giueth light to euery man, as much as lyes in it, though blinde men ſee neuer a whit, the better: So this true light, offereth
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21009:167"/> himſelfe to al men, ſhineth vpon euery man, that who ſo wil may bee inlightned by him. It may ſeem perhaps to ſome man, that <hi>inlightning</hi> ſignifies a farder matter, then ſhining vpon a man; and ſo, I remember, it was obſerued at verſe the fift, <hi>The light ſhineth in darkneſſe.</hi> Thoſe blind men, I named ere while, had the Sunne ſhining on them, but yet they were not inlightned: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by <hi>inlightning</hi> we vnderſtand no more, but being made viſible, that we may be ſeene. And in that ſenſe indeed, a tree, or a ſtone, is inlightned by the Sunne, as wel as any liuing creature, that hath eies to ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. This cannot bee the meaning of the Euangeliſt. For he ſpeakes not of any mans being made knowne, or apparant to other men; but of euery mans knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſeeing thoſe matters, which concerne his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluation. That is to bee inlightned; to haue the doctrine of ſaluation declared to him; ſo that hee diſcerne, and acknowledge it for ſuch, the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being made manifeſt to his conſcience; or at the leaſt the ſenſe of that, which is deliuered, being euident, and cleere vnto him. If this later point bee not performed; ſurely there is no <hi>inlightning,</hi> but at the moſt, <hi>ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word, which our Euangeliſt vſeth in this place, ſignifieth in the Scripture, both the holding out of light, by which, things may be made viſible to men, and the giuing of them ſight, by which they may ſee. <hi>Candles</hi> are ſaid, <hi>to light vs with their brightneſſe;</hi> that is, to afford <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 36.</note> vs light, by meanes whereof things may bee ſeene. And in this ſenſe, the things that are ſeene, to ſpeake truly, and properly are inlightned, and not wee, in whom there is no alteration, by the preſence of the light; but only the forme, or ſhape of that, which is to be ſeene, is preſented to our view by the light ſhining vpon it, and bringing the proportion, and colours of it to our eies. This ſignification of the word is the more
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21009:167"/> common of the 2: <hi>Iudge nothing before the time, vntill the Lorde come, who will lighten things, that are hid in darkneſſe.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 5.</note> In this place of Scripture, as euery one ſees, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is referred to the things, that ſhall be ſeene; which being hidden ſhall be diſcoured, and made viſible, or rather layd open to all mens view. But the Scripture hath examples of the other ſignification alſo. <hi>I ceaſe not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to giue thanks for you, making menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>of you in my prayers, &amp;c. that the eies of your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may bee inlightned, that you may knowe what the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe. 18.</note> 
               <hi>hope is of your calling &amp;c.</hi> This inlightning of the eies of the vnderſtanding, is not onely affording of light, by which the things themſelues, that are to bee ſeene, may become viſible (for that is done by the miniſtery of the worde, whereby the hidden myſteries of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are revealed to all, that will heare) but an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart, and an inward teaching of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; ſo that a man ſhall thereby bee perſwaded of the truth thereof. For, the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle writ this, had heard the Goſpell preached by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe; and by that peaching of his, had the light vouchſaf't them, by which the knowledge of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation might be had; and, in ſome meaſure alſo, had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to the vnderſtanding, and acknowledging of the truth, which the Apoſtles praye to haue far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reuealed to them, that they might beleeue, and embrace it. This, the ſame Apoſtle in an other place, calls the receiuing of light. Many haue light, and <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 32.</note> knoweledge offered them, but they receiue it not: either becauſe it ſeemes not worth the receiuing, or for that they are drawne away by their worldly cares, or ſome other ſuch reſpects, from the due conſideration of that whereof there is offer made them. But the Hebrewes (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there writes) had receiued the light, that is, had giuen aſſent to the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21009:168"/> truth of that, which was taught them, and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it, had indured (as it is there witneſſes) greate fight in afflictions.</p>
            <p>If we take the word in the former ſenſe, only for ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon the things, that are needfull to bee ſeene, that they may ſhew themſelues vnto vs; it is out of doubt, that, in reſpect thereof, euery man is inlightned, for ſo much as concernes the office of the light; which is to make manifeſt thoſe things that were not, without it, to be ſeene. For ſo our Lord hath revealed the will of his Father, concerning the meanes of ſaluation; which, <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 18.</note> but by him, had neuer beene publiſht, and proclaimed to al the world. But this is rather lightning, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; as he, that carries a candle, or torch with him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens not the party, before whom he goes, or to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he comes, but only lights him: and in this ſenſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour doth but ſhewe men, what is to bee beleeued. Whereon there growes more queſtion, how it may be ſaid, that euery man is thus lighted. For it is very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that there were many thouſands in the world, euen then, when our Sauiour himſelfe ſhone ſo brightly, by his glorious workes, and powerfull preaching, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard, or ſaw the one or other, nor, in any likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of reaſon, poſſibly could do. What ſay I? There were many thouſandes. I may truly ſay, the thouſand man then liuing, neuer had, nor could haue any ſight of the light, that then ſhined among the Iewes. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the light ſtretcht, and ſpread his beames, to the vttermoſt of his nature, and ſtrength. Take example of the Sunne, which in the height of ſummer riſeth early, mounts highe, ſhines gloriouſly, ſets late; and yet there are diuers nations in the worlde, which haue not the leaſt glimſe of his light, all the while, he ſhewes himſelfe to vs, in theſe parts of the Hemiſphere, moſt apparant and bright. Therefore when we read or heare, <hi>That our Sauiour, the true light, lighteth euery man,</hi> as much as in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:21009:168"/> him lies, we muſt not conſider him as God, but as the mediator of mankind become man. As he was God, he could haue giuen euery one, then liuing in the worlde, certaine knowledge, that himſelfe was ordained for the Sauiour of the world. But he was heere to demeane him ſelfe as a perſon, who, by the diuine power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, could do al things; but, by the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, was to doe no more, then his humane nature might be known to be imployed in, ſome way or other. He taught the admirable ſecrets of God, by his voice; he wrought wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful miracles by his almighty power: but ſtill it appeared to all men, that by the word, and wil of him, whom they ſaw to be a man, all thoſe wonders weredon. So then, if we take this <hi>lightning of euery man,</hi> for affording them the meanes of knowledge to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt thus conceiue the matter; that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our preacht, and ſhew'd his miracles by himſelfe, and his Apoſtles, and doth daily vouchſafe the knowledge of the truth to euery man, without exception, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding his miniſters to teach any man, nor barring any from learning of them.</p>
            <p>Let vs now ſee, how we are to vnderſtand the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, that <hi>the true light inlightneth euery man.</hi> Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cauſeth him to diſcerne the truth of that, which is deliuered: ſo that the doctrine of the Goſpell is alwaies effectuall to him, that is inlightned. <hi>The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that ſhee attended to the things, that Paul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> 
               <hi>ſpake.</hi> All, that heard him, were lighted; but they only <hi>inlightned,</hi> which beleeued the things, hee ſpake. How then may Chriſt be ſaid to inlighten euery man, ſince it is apparant, many, yea the greateſt part, beleeue not? Surely the former anſwer ſatisfies this doubt very ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently. Whoſoeuer is inlightned, hath this inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the true light. And this interpretation (as I ſhewed before) agreeth very well with the Euangeliſts words, and meaning. But let vs apply the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:21009:169"/> to this purpoſe. Chriſt inlightneth euery man as much as lies in him. If wee vnderſtand this of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power, wherby he is able, as God, to do al things, it is manifeſtly falſe. Elſe ſhould euery man vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue. For he is able to beget faith in the heart of euery man. Therfore the moſt, that can bee truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucht in this matter, is this, that hee is ready to inlighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery man. But this interpretation, as far as I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, doth not fully expreſſe the ſenſe of the place, if wee expound it of inlightning. For it is one thing to inlighten, an other thing to bee ready to inlighten.</p>
            <p>What could the Euangeliſt ſay more of them, that are actually inlightned? I acknowledge the truth of the doctrine, that our Lord is ready to refreſh all, that come vnto him, to teach all, that vſe the meanes to learne; but <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> me thinkes this is not all, that the holy Ghoſt in this place affirmes. Therefore I had rather interpret the text, either of <hi>lightning,</hi> that the true light ſhines to all, without exception, no man being ſhut out from the hearing, and reading of the Scriptures, by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, or reſtraint of the light it ſelfe; or of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning,</hi> that all, which are made partakers thereof at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to it, only by this true light: and both theſe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, are true, and may agree with the words, &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Euangeliſt, to commend our Sauiour Chriſt, as the true light of all men.</p>
            <p>Now whereas ſome men herevpon would conclude, that becauſe the true light inlightens euery man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath not made choiſe of any man, more then of all men, to be heires of his glory in heauen, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, which growes not of the text. I will make it plaine by a ſhort examination of the matter, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former interpretations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man is barr'd the miniſtery of the worde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaluation is intended alike to all.</hi> If you adde, <hi>in</hi>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:21009:169"/> 
               <hi>regard of the miniſtery thereof,</hi> yet that you ſay will hardly proue true. For though no man, be abbridg'd of liberty to heare, by any charge to the contrary from God; yet many are not vouchſaf't the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of hearing. How ſhall wee affirme then, that in reſpect of the miniſtery of the worde, ſaluation was intended alike to all? I graunt, that the meanes is affoorded in generall; but I deny that therefore there is no difference in Gods purpoſe, touching lightning of one nation, more then of an other. It is as free (for any reſtraint made by God) for the Turkes to haue the Goſpell, as for vs; For they are Gentiles, as well as wee. But yet it were too greate vnthankfulneſſe, and abſurdity, to ſay, that (concerning the miniſtery of the worde) God meant to light them to ſaluation, as well as vs. Nomy brethren, let not ſuch a thought enter into your harts, as once to imagin, that the Lord meanes no more good to you, for your ſaluation, by vouchſafing you the miniſtery of the Goſpel, then to them, whom he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to continew in their ignorance, to their certaine deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Let no man deceiue you, by ſaying, that the light, (as much as lies in it) lighteth euery man. It denies no man light, it blinds no mans eies, it hides it ſelfe from no man that would ſee it: But it offers it ſelfe to ſome men, it ſhines into their eies, it ſeeks them out, where they are in darknes, &amp; follows them, when they turne their backs, and flee from it. Haue not wee had experience of this bountifulnes? Call to mind thoſe daies of darknes, when our forefathers lay buried in blindnes, and ignorance. Did we run after the light, or did it come to vs? Was it not ſcorn'd, reiected, hated? Did it not ſhine vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lids, when wee ſhut them, becauſe wee would not ſee? What rip I vp matters of antiquity? I will ſay nothing of our returning into Aegypt, in Queene <hi>Maryes</hi>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:21009:170"/> daies, of our perſecuting the truth, and murdering the Saints of God, for holding out the light to vs, that wee might ſee. Behold, the light is come againe vnto vs, it ſhines in at our windows, it winds it ſelfe into our harts, it preſents it ſelfe to our ſight, which way ſoeuer wee turne. And is it poſſible, any man ſhould be found, that will not acknowledge an eſpeciall purpoſe, and deſire in the light, to make vs ſee? What? no more, then to light the Turkes? For pure ſhame I will ſay no more of the matter: Cheefly becauſe I reſerue this point of vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall grace for a fitter opportunity.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt needs ſpeake a word or two of the other expoſition. <hi>The true light is ready to inlighten euery man.</hi> Let me graunt that interpretation, what then? <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it not readier to inlighten ſome, then other ſome?</hi> How ſhall that be proued? It is ready to inlighten ſome: Some other it doth inlighten. The former anſwere may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. It is ready, ſo that it refuſeth not to giue light to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man; but ſome men it neuer lins ſhining vpon, till it haue gotten paſſage to the vnderſtanding, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that fully of the truth. <hi>It is giuen to you</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour) <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 11.</note> 
               <hi>to knowe the ſecrets of the kingdome of heauen, but to them it is not giuen.</hi> The light ſhone, to the Scribes, Phariſes, and people, and as (theſe men ſay) was ready to inlighten them: but the Apoſtles were inlightned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It was giuen them by him, that, according to his good pleaſure, reuealeth the Goſpell to babes, &amp; men <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 21.</note> of ſmall vnderſtanding, and hides it from the wiſe, and learned. Tel me not of the good vſe of Free-wil, or any other preparedneſſe, in the hearts of them, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned; as if the difference were from man, and not from God. I may not ſtand now to diſpute that matter, but wil take the firſt occaſion to handle it, that offers it ſelfe: I hope in my next Sermon to ſpeake ſomewhat of it. In the meane time, let it bee enough for vs, touching the point in queſtion, to vnderſtand, that the light, as
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:21009:170"/> ready as it is (and it is moſt ready) neuer inlightens any man, whome it ſelfe doth not firſt fitte, and diſpoſe to receiue that light; as I will ſhewe, if it pleaſe God, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>It is Chriſt then, euen the true light, which inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens euery man. <hi>Of his fulneſſe</hi> (ſaith our Euangeliſt) <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>haue wee all receiued.</hi> Yea, <hi>I.</hi> Baptiſt himſelfe, that ſhone with ſuch extraordinary brightneſſe, had his light <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 34.</note> from him, who had the ſpirit without meaſure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he truly, and freely profeſſe himſelfe, that hee was not worthy to carry his ſhooes after him. VVee heard at the fourth verſe, the teſtimonies of <hi>Zachary</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 78. 79. &amp; 2. 32.</note> and <hi>Simeon</hi> to this purpoſe; that hee was the light of the Gentiles. I will not ſpende time in repeating them: nor in vrging the exhortation, which then I preſſed, of truſting to Chriſt with confidence, how great ſoeuer our darkneſſe bee. Only giue mee leaue, I pray you, to apply the generality of this inlightning, to our particular inſtruction, and comfort.</p>
            <p>Chriſt the true light, lightneth euery man. VVho may then except himſelfe, or any other man? Yet there are two ſortes of people, that make queſtion of this doctrine: The poore ſoule, that is priuy to his owne ignorance, and the deſperate wretch, that woulde excuſe his wickedneſſe. The one diſcomfortes his heart, with too much care. The other deſtroies his ſoule, with prophane careleſneſſe. Theſe mens caſes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, are very diuers; yet thus much may be ſaid to them both in generall. The true light ſhines to euery man in the miniſtery of the word. What warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or reaſon haue either of you, to exempt your ſelues out of this number? Are not you, compriſed vnder theſe generall tearmes, <hi>euery one?</hi> No Country, no age, no ſexe, no eſtate, is without the reach of them, Let mee come nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</p>
            <p>No particular perſon whatſoeuer is excluded; but
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:21009:171"/> the light ſhewes his brightneſſe for all, and euery one that will ſee it.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion is now of none, but them, who liue in thoſe places, where this light doth ſhine; that is, where the Goſpell is knowne, and profeſt. Can any ſuch man truly ſay, the light is not for him? Who tells thee ſo? The holy Ghoſt heere affirmes the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>It lights euery man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVell: let vs examine the matter, ſomewhat more particularly. Stand foorth, thou, that deſperatly ſettſt all at ſix, and ſeauen; becauſe (forſooth) God will not haue euery man to bee inlightned, or lighted. If hee woulde haue no man, there were ſome reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n thy doing. For then, it were in vaine to looke after the light; neither would there haue beene any means afforded to that pupoſe. But ſince thou confeſſeſt, that ſome are to be inlightned, what excuſe can there bee for thy careleſſneſſe? All ſhall not be inlightned; why then ſhould I care to ſeeke the light? ſome ſhall be: why ſhouldſt thou not care then? If all ſhould, it would come vtterly without thy care; Then mighteſt thou reaſon in this ſort; All ſhall bee inlightned; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I too: why ſhould I then trouble my ſelfe about it? But to diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> as thou doſt; ſome ſhall not be inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Therefore I will bee altogether careleſſe; argues a ſenſleſſe deſperatneſſe. I am ſure thou wilt grant, it is as cleere and certaine, that God will not haue all men to bee learned, or to bee of any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or trade, as that hee will not haue all men to bee inlightned. Anſwere mee then, why thou doſt apply thy ſelfe to ſtudy, or to any courſe of life whatſoeuer. For I preſume, thinke what thou wilt, thou wilt neuer bee ſo deſperate, as to ſaye, or ſo abſurde, as to imagine. that thou wilt bee of this, or that profeſſion, whether God will, or no. Let mee reaſon againſt thee, as thy ſelfe
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21009:171"/> didſt ere while. God will not haue all men to bee Schollers; Therefore will I neuer beſtow any paines in ſtudy. I may ſay the like of Marchants. Marriners, Mercers, Grocers, and of euery trade. So that, by this gay reaſon, no man ſhoulde euer betake himſelfe to any courſe of life, but wander idly vppe, and downe, or rather lye ſtill and ſterue.</p>
            <p>And yet ſuch are the goodly argumentes, by which prophane men blaſpheame the vnſearchable counſails of God, and procure iuſt damnation to their own ſoules. That, which they may cleerely ſee, they will not looke vpon; That, which they cannot poſſibly diſcerne, they wil be alwaies gaſing on. They are curious to ſearch out what God hath determined of them in himſelfe: Careleſs to vnderſtand what he hath appointed, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his word. It is ſet downe in plaine words, and often, that <hi>God will haue all men to bee ſaued, and to come to the</hi>

               <hi>knowledge of his truth; that the grace of God, which bringeth ſaluation to all men, hath appeared.</hi> The Scripture is full of ſuch ſpeeches. All theſe are paſt ouer, as many, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as plaine as they are; and wretched men, to cloake their owne wickedneſſe, wil heare, and thinke of nothinge, but Gods ſecret predeſtination. I haue been too long in this point already, let me conclude in one worde: where the light ſhines, if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not inlightned, it is becauſe he cares not for the light, not that the light hides it ſelfe from him.</p>
            <p>Then maiſt thou conceiue good hope, that ſigheſt, &amp; groneſt vnder the burden of thine ignorance, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by al meanes to come to knowledge. VVill hee (thinkſt thou) that offereth his light, where it is refus'd, &amp; deſpiſed, withdraw it, where it is deſired, and ſought for? <hi>He came</hi> (as himſelfe profeſſeth) <hi>to ſeeke, and to ſaue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat 18. 11. &amp; 12. 28.</note> 
               <hi>that which was loſt.</hi> And wil he caſt away thoſe, that ſeek to him? <hi>Com to me al ye that labour, &amp; are heauy laden.</hi> Doth he cal them to him, that he may beat them away when

But I cannot come to him (ſaiſt thou) for want of knowledge; Nay (ſay I) thou wouldſt not come to him, but that thou haſt knowledge: knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thou art a ſinner, knowledge that hee is a Sauiour. Art thou not inlightned? <hi>The darkneſſe doth not comprehend him.</hi> No man acknowledgeth him truly to be the Lorde of life, but hee, that hath learned of God, that hee is ſo. It fares with thee, as it did with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when the Angell brought him out of priſon. <hi>Hee roſe, and followed the Angell and knewe not that it was true,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 12. 9.</note> 
               <hi>which was done by the Angell, but thought it had beene a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> And it is ſaid of the Iewes in the Pſalme, that <hi>they</hi>

               <hi>were like men that dreamt, when the Lord brought againe the captiuity of Sion.</hi> Thy caſe is much like theſe mens. Thou haſt receiued light, and knowſt it not; But admit thou wert not inlightned. Surely thou maiſt bee, if thou wilt. The light, thou ſeeſt, ſhines all about thee: wherefor but to bee ſeene, and receiued? why not by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, aſwell, as by an other? It lights, it inlightneth euery man. Plucke vppe thy hearte, wipe the teares from thine eies, that dymme thy ſight. Doe not thinke thou haſt no light, becauſe a farre of, thou ſeeſt a greater, then thine is. If an other man haue a Torch, or a Creſſet to light him, and thou but a candle, to ſhewe thee the way; yet thou art not without light. Perhaps he hath farder to goe, perhaps his way is more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. It may bee, if thy light were greater, thy care, and heedfulneſſe would be leſſe. God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned out thy light, according to thy need; thou haſt light, though not ſo much, as thou wouldſt haue: If thou haue none, thou ſhalt haue. <hi>He inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Such is the effect of the light, in its owne nature, ſuch would it be in the hearts of men, if it were receiued.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:21009:172"/> as it deſires, and ought to bee. The Evangeliſt told vs before, that <hi>the light ſhineth in darkneſſe,</hi> but without any good intertainement. <hi>The darkneſſe comprehended it not.</hi> Thoſe two points he amply fieth farder in theſe verſes; firſt the offer, which the light makes of it ſelfe. <hi>Hee was in the world; He came to his owne.</hi> Then the refuſall of that offer; <hi>the world knewe him not, His owne receiued him not.</hi> I will handle the verſes, as they ly, and ſpeak ſeuerally of <hi>His being in the world, and not being knowne; of his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming to his owne, and not being receiued by them.</hi> So that each verſe hath two partes; our Sauiour Chriſts kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in offering, and mens vnkindneſſe in refuſing. In the former verſe, the offer is in theſe wordes. <hi>Hee was in the world;</hi> the refuſall in the reſt. For the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the offer; we muſt conſider theſe 2 things; what is meant by <hi>the world,</hi> what by being in the world is ſignified. The knowledge of theſe two points, will diſcouer the Euangeliſts meaning.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore of <hi>the world,</hi> which hath diuers ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in the Scripture, as this oneverſe may teach vs; where it is taken in two different ſenſes, at the leaſt, if not in 3. That I may ſpeake of it as orderly, and as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can; wee are to vnderſtand, that <hi>The world</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſignifies the whole creature, or whatſoeuer was created. <hi>The inuiſible things of God</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>are ſeene by the creation of the world.</hi> This is that <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> world, which in this verſe is ſaid to haue beene made by Chriſt. The ſame, a little before, was called <hi>All things. By him were all things made.</hi> Only it may <note place="margin">Verſe. 3.</note> well be thought, that in the former place, the Angells are not ſignified; becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of the knowledge of God by the light of nature: which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will not ſerue to ſhew vs the Angels. In this ſenſe, alſo it is to be vnderſtood, whereſoeuer there is ſpeech of the beginning, or foundation of the world. <hi>As hee hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:21009:173"/> that is, before any thing was created. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignifications of the worde flowe from this one: which is the firſt, and principall, varyed as neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quired, or delight perſwaded.</p>
            <p>The next moſt generall obſeruation is this, that the worde is put for ſome part, or member of the whole. Sometimes for the whole frame, &amp; compaſſe of heauen, and earth; wherein the reſt of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are contained; So ſpeakes the Apoſtle; <hi>God</hi>

Let vs now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to our preſent purpoſe, for the vnderſtanding of the holy Ghoſts meaning.</p>
            <p>But we cannot certainely determine, in what ſenſe <hi>the world</hi> is here ſpoken of, till we knowe of what <hi>being in the world,</hi> the Euangeliſt is to be vnderſtood. Now our Lord may be ſaid to haue beene in the worlde, in two
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:21009:174"/> reſpects; either as he was God, or as he was the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> In the former ſenſe he was alwaies, and is ſtill, and euer ſhall bee, after the ſame ſort in the world. In the later, he was not in the world, till he tooke fleſh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his mother; nor ſince his aſcenſion into heauen. As God, by his prouidence, power, and wiſdome, he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and gouernes al things. As the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he taught and informed the world, of his Fathers will, touching the ſaluation of mankind. His being in the world as God, was, and is, for the preſeruation of naturall life: His preſence, as <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> was to bring ſupernaturall life, by the light of grace. Whether of the two is it mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e likely the holy Ghoſt meaneth in this place? If we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the former, ſeeing hee ſpeakes not of the nature of the Godhead (which is the ſame in all three perſons) but of the perſon of the Sonne; how can the world be iuſtly condemned for not knowing him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was preſent? For it is a rul'd caſe in diuinity, that the myſtery of the Trinity cannot bee diſcerned by the light of nature, or gathered from any contemplation of the creatures. It is true indeed, that ſince it pleaſed God to reueale this incomprehenſible ſecret, many men haue labored, to ſet forth the point by ſimilitudes, and to apply ſomethings, in the creatures, to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting of the trinity in vnity.</p>
            <p>But all the light, they bringe to this point, is ſuch, as rather ſhewes, that themſelues were perſwaded of that truth, then is of force to conuince their Iudgement, that will not beleeue. In one worde. they giue vs to vnderſtand, that ſuch a thing, in likelyhood, maye bee; they doe not demonſtrate, that, of neceſſity, it muſt bee. As for thoſe ſhadowes of this myſtery, which ſeeme toly hid heere, and there, in the writinges of ſome Philoſophers; neither are they ſufficient to argue, that the penners of thoſe books
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:21009:174"/> acquainted with the doctrine of the Trinitie; and they are ſo ſparingly, and fearfully deliuered, that a man may eaſily ſee, they were altogether vncertaine of the truth, and almoſt of the meaning of that, they writ. And in what authors doe wee meete with any ſhewe of theſe matters? but onely in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who profeſs they receiued their inſtruction from the Egyptians, and Chaldeans; who learned thoſe points by Tradition from <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſo from <hi>Adam;</hi> to whom God reuealed the knowledge thereof; or elſe are knowne to haue beene the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Hebrewes from time to time.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it ſuite well with the courſe of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts writing, to expound this <hi>being in the world,</hi> of ſuch naturall maintaining thereof. For, the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, from the beginning of the fourth verſe (as I haue ſhewed) is a deſcription of the Meſſiah Such was the life, that wee haue in him; ſuch the light, wee receiue from him: wholly ſupernaturall. Of that, <hi>Iohn</hi> beares witneſſe; not of his creating, or preſeruing all thinges. That was it, which he laboured to haue all men beleeue. That is the thing, which our Euangeliſt denies of the Baptiſt. <hi>Hee was not the light.</hi> In regard of that, is our Sauiour called <hi>the true light.</hi> Who ſhall perſwade mee then, to apply this verſe to his diuine power of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and not to the gratious worke of his med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ation? eſpecially conſidering the next verſe is generally (for the moſt part) ſo interpreted, and (as it is apparant by the verſe following) ought to be. Wherfore I willingly ſubſcribe to their opinion, who vnderſtand this place of <note place="margin">Gaudentius in Euang. tract. 12</note> our Lords being in the world, all the time, he liued here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon earth, in the nature and ſhape of man. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereby ſome men would prooue the contrarie, are of no great force. They ſay, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would cleere our Sauiour, from being thought to haue beene in fault, that men did not beleeue, and from being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee a creature. But both theſe doubts were ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:21009:175"/> before more ſufficiently: and the later ariſeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that, which is heere affirmed; <hi>Hee was in the world;</hi> as if the Euangeliſt had made himſelfe more worke then needed. It was ſayde before, that <hi>the light ſhineth in darkeneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that it lighteth, or inlightneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man.</hi> Yea, the fault of not beleeuing was layde, where it is; <hi>The darkeneſſe comprehended it not.</hi> How then could the light bee ſuſpected? Or how ſhould hee bee taken to bee a creature? but in regard of his manhood; which is no error, nor inconuenience. Hee was auoucht before to <hi>be God, and to haue made all things, none excepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then ſeeing wee haue found, that <hi>This being in the world,</hi> is to bee vnderſtood of our Sauiours conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with men, here in the fleſh: it is no hard matter to know, what is meant by <hi>the world,</hi> &amp; from thence to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the meaning of the Euangeliſt. What is the world? what elſe but the earth? Therefore when the Euangeliſt ſaith, <hi>He was in the world,</hi> his meaning is, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> of whom he hath ſpoken ſo much, was conuerſant here vpon earth amongſt men. This he deliuereth here in this general deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before he come to the hiſtory it ſelf, which ſetteth out the courſe of his life, and carriage at large. It is needleſſe to ſay any thing in proofe of this matter. I ſhall haue neceſſarie occaſion to handle it at the foureteenth verſe, &amp; the whole Goſpel is of nothing elſe. Yet I may not forget to note in a word, how grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly it pleaſed the Son of God to deale with the world. He liued amongſt men, he kept company with men, he came (as himſelfe ſpeaketh) <hi>eating, and drinking.</hi> He was <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 34.</note> familiar with men, hee applyed himſelfe to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and faſhions in all thinges lawfull; and (as a worthy Scholler of ſo excellent a Maiſter ſayth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) <hi>Hee became all things to all men, that hee might by</hi>

               <hi>all meanes ſaue ſome. Iohn</hi> Baptiſt (as it was fitte for him) led an auſtere life; withdrawing himſelfe from
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21009:175"/> the company of men, abſtayning from the lawfull vſe of that varietie, both in diet, and apparayle, which the Lord of his rich bountie, hath afforded to men. They that would in any thing vſe his miniſterie, either for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or baptiſme, were fayne to come to him, and attend vpon him Our Sauiour was ready (ordinarily) at euery mans call. Who euer came with petition to him and went away vnſatisfied? Sometimes hee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 49.</note> the matter, and would make as if hee hearde not; yea, ſometimes hee ſeemed to aunſwere ſomewhat roughly, as to the woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but it was <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 21.</note> not to deny their requeſts, but to encreaſe their faith. He meant not by ſuch delayes to continue their paine, or trouble, but to double his mercy, both vppon their bodies, and vpon their ſoules. Where hee ſawe neede of helpe, and want of meanes to begge it, by reaſon of ignoraunce, or ſome other infirmitie, hee moſt kindly offred himſelfe and his ſeruice. <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> ſayth he to the man, that had lyen 38 yeares <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>bed-red.</hi> To conclude, ſuch was the conuerſation of our Sauiour vpon earth, that nothing wanted to ſhewe who hee was; nothing hindred men (commonly) from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him, but that, which, in all reaſon, ſhould haue allured them: ſo great maieſtie, with ſo great meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſuch power to helpe, with ſuch readineſſe to bee imployed. <hi>O the blindneſſe of men!</hi> ſayth one: <hi>O the pride, and frowardneſſe!</hi> ſayth another. <hi>They worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſhed, that made themſelues vnworthie of ſuch vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued kindneſſe. What would they haue had, more then was offered them? yea they could neuer haue deſired ſo much, as was afforded them. And could they bee ſo vnkinde ſhall I ſay, or vnwiſe and wilfull? as to make light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of:</hi> ſtay your ſentence a little; we are not come to that point. Take heede leaſt by reprouing of other, you condemne yourſelues. What want you, except the bodily preſence of Chriſt, that they had? No one man,

            <p>That, which they might heare, in a long time, by peecemeale; wee may read, in a few howers, altogether before occaſions of manifold buſines diſtract the mind, and confound the memory.

               </gap>he eyes of men might bee fed, If they heard him ſpeak to ſignifie that he would haue ſuch or ſuch a thing done and ſawe the effect enſue accordingly, it was all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage they had of vs, that now liue, and euery day may heare, and read the hiſtorie of theſe thinges recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If hee were then amongſt men in his perſon, hee is now amongſt them in his word. I wil ſay nothing of the difference betwixt theſe two meanes of bringing men to beleefe. Let the euent ſpeake. It is manifeſt by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the acts, that more were conuerted to the faith, in one yeare, after our Sauiours death, by the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the word, in the mouthes of the Apoſtles; then in all the three yeares, and vpwarde of his preaching, and working miracles. The vſe of this later was but to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the perſons, that their doctrine might bee receiued. Wee profeſſe, that wee are reſolued of the trueth of all things deliuered in the Scriptures. Then certainely our Lord is amongſt vs in theſe dayes, though not in the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, yet in as great meaſure for means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and beleeuing.</p>
            <p>What intertainement had hee then by them; hath he now by vs? The former wee muſt learne of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, of the later wee ſhall heare more anone. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the people, that liued in our Sauiour Chriſts time and heard, and ſawe, what he ſpake, and did; what
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21009:176"/> would any reaſonable man looke for, but that they ſhould acknowledge him, and honour him, as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, by truſting in him? So they ſhould haue done. And did they ſo? Read the record. <hi>The world knewe him not.</hi> Is it poſſible there ſhould bee ſuch blindneſſe, where there was ſo good light? Could the light bee vnſeene, that ſhone ſo brightly? It is woorth the doing, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this point a little better. And firſt, let vs examine the wordes, what is meant by <hi>the world,</hi> what by not <hi>knowing.</hi> The world in the firſt part of this verſe, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the earth, the place, where men ordinarily liue, &amp; abide; ſo that by Chriſts being in the world (as I ſayd) his conuerſing, and liuing vpon the earth among men was noted. In the ſecond part, <hi>The worlde was made by him</hi> (that I may diſpatch this point at once) the worde is taken in the moſt generall ſenſe, for all thinges crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; heauen, and earth, and whatſoeuer is contained in them. This laſt clauſe affordes vs a third ſignification of the worde, more particularly then either of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>The world knewe him not.</hi> It was not required, nor could bee lookt for, that the frame of the heauens, or the Globe of the earth, that the Sunne, Moone, or Starres, that the beaſts of the fielde, the foules of the ayre, or the fiſhes of the Sea ſhuld take knowledge of the Meſſiah. None, but ſuch creatures, as were indued with reaſon, could bee capable thereof. The Angells it concerned not: neither are they at any time called the world. It remaines then, that by the <hi>world</hi> men onely are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>And of them it is ſayd, that <hi>They knew not Chriſt.</hi> In what reſpecft did they not knowe him. As hee is God Almightie, the Creator, and preſeruer of all things, he was generally acknowledged, through the world. For there neuer was any people ſo rude, or barbarous, but they had a perſwaſion, that there was a God, and that hee was to bee worſhipt. But herein, as the Apoſtle
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:21009:177"/> ſayth, <hi>They are without excuſe, becauſe knowing God, they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>do not glorifie him, as God, neither are thankefull:</hi> yea (as it followeth afterwards) <hi>they turne the truth of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> 
               <hi>a lye, and worſhippe, and ſerue the creature, rather then the Creator.</hi> By which it is manifeſt, that the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt doth not ſpeake heere, of our Lords being in the world, by his continuall prouidence, and gouernment, as I noted before. Neither may wee vnderſtand it of the Perſon, which by no light of nature, either bred in the ſoule, or receiued from the creatures, could poſſibly be deſcryed.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee muſt needes interpret this knowledge, of acknowledging our Sauiour for the Meſſiah, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, accordingly, for ſpiritual deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, death, and damnation.</p>
            <p>It is further to bee obſerued, in this part of the verſe, that the Euangeliſt chaungeth his ſpeech, and whereas before hee had ſpoken the light, to which, <hi>It</hi> ſhould aunſwere; now in ſteede of that, hee ſayth <hi>him: The worlde knewe him not.</hi> Whome did not the worlde knowe? In the next verſe before, hee mentioned the light; Therefore he ſhould now haue ſayde; <hi>The worlde knewe it not.</hi> The Greeke expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth neither <hi>It</hi> nor <hi>him,</hi> in the two former clauſes; but becauſe in this laſt, the Euangeliſt expoundes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaying <hi>him,</hi> and not <hi>it,</hi> therefore wee ſupply that worde, in both the other. As for the reaſon, why Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> vſeth the vſeth the worde <hi>him,</hi> wee muſt remember, that hee ſpeakes of the perſon of the Meſſiah, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee deſcribe him, by calling him <hi>the life, and the light.</hi> Now to the perſon, <hi>Hee,</hi> and <hi>Him</hi> agree verie fitly. In the Originall, <hi>The Word</hi> is of the ſame gender, that <hi>hee</hi> is of; yet might wee not ſo ſpeake of it in Engliſh, but that wee haue reſpect in our ſpeech, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the perſon, then to any titles, by which he is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to vs.</p>
            <pb n="351" facs="tcp:21009:177"/>
            <p>Thus then wee are to conceiue the Euangeliſts meaning, that to amplifie the kindneſſe of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in offering ſaluation to the worlde, hee ſets foorth the great, and incredible vnkindeneſſe of men: who would not, or (at the leaſt) did not acknowledge him, that they might bee ſaued. But you will ſay, This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is too generall againſt the world; ſeeing it is well knowne, euen by record in the Goſpell it ſelf, that, from time to time, many beleeued in him. This, ſome men diſcerning, reſtraine the worlde to the wicked of the <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. 7. in Ioan.</note> world, who refuſed to beleeue.</p>
            <p>But the accuſation in the Euangeliſt is all one, though wee ſo expound it. <hi>The worlde</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>knewe him not.</hi> And I thinke wee ſhall hardly finde <hi>the worlde,</hi> anye where in Scripture taken for the wicked, but where there is ſome oppoſition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, or ſignified, betwixt them, and the godly. <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them that thou haſt giuen mee out of the world.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh, 17, 9,</note>
            </p>
            <p>Who ſees not, that in this ſentence, the world, or wicked are oppoſed to the godly, whome the Lord hath choſen out of the world? And yet euen in this, and the like examples, we may very well, <hi>by the world,</hi> vnderſtand men in generall. <hi>The worlde cannot hate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap 7, 7.</note> 
               <hi>you, but mee it doth hate.</hi> What is that elſe, but as if our Lord ſhould haue ſayde, men cannot hate you, but they hate me? It is true indeede, that the reaſon of this hatred is the wickedneſſe of men; but this wickedneſſe is ſo generall, that it may truly be affirmed of the world, in ſuch generall tearmes. The fore although ſome few, whoſe hearts it pleaſed God extraordinarily to inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and incline, did confeſſe him to bee the Meſſiah: yet generally, <hi>the world</hi> did not know him, as Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> not without cauſe, complaynes.</p>
            <p>For to whome may it not worthily ſeeme ſtrange; that a perſonage of ſuch worth, &amp; excellency, ſhould make
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:21009:178"/> himſelfe knowne to men, in ſuch a wonderfull ſort, and yet not bee acknowledged to bee ſuch an one, as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly he was?

               <hi>brought Bulles with Garlands, and would haue ſacrificed with the people.</hi> Behold I pray you, what effect one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was able to worke in the hearts of ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.

Compare our Lords manie and admirable miracles, with this one worke of the Apoſtles; ſuppoſing it had beene done by their owne power, and vertue. Looke not that I ſhould ſtand to reckon vppe the particulars; take a viewe of them in groſſe, as they are reheaiſed to <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples: <hi>The blind receiued ſight, the halt were made able to goe, the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>

            <p>I appeale now to the iudgement of all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men. What could the world imagine, in this caſe? To deme, that ſuch miracles were wrought, it was abſurd, and ſenſeleſſe. Their owne eyes refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. Should they haue excepted againſt the trueth of that, which ſeemed to bee done? Triall by ſenſe would haue conuinced them. Perhappes, they might aſcribe them to naturall cauſes. All reaſon, Phyſicke, and Phyloſophy diſclayme that power. Muſt wee not of neceſſitie confeſſe (vnleſſe we will bee altogether ſhameleſſe) that none but God, was able to doe ſuch wonders? was it poſſible then, hee ſhould not bee knowne? I ſee, wee are all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to inueigh againſt their blindneſſe, if they could not; their peruerſneſſe, if they would not knowe him. And I confeſſe, they deſerue to bee infamous for it, to all poſteritie. But it is more honour to reſcue a friende, then to kill an enemie: More wiſedome to looke, that there bee nothing in our ſelues worthy or ſuch iuſt blame, then to reprooue the faults of othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was the ſinne and ſhame of thoſe times, that the Meſſiah, liuing in that ſort amongſt men, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, by fewe or none of them. Are men in theſe dayes excuſable? you will ſay I. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that Ieſus is indeede the Sauiour of the world. Whence aryſeth this perſwaſion? It is rather ſuckt in with our nurſes milke, then receiued by the inſtruction of our teachers. Wee hould it, becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beleeued, not becauſe it is certainely true. Wee heare not of any other meanes; and therefore wee are content to accept of theſe. They are not choſen by vs, vppon our owne iudgement, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21009:179"/> vpon common credite. We follow the tyde, and ſtreame of the flood, being readie to turne with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whenſoeuer it ſhall ebbe. I would to God olde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, did not cauſe new doubt. It is an imputation that lyes vpon our Nation generally, as the writers of hiſtories record, that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer eaſily, and looſe as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily; wee get many Townes, and Forts, yea ſometimes Kingdomes, but wee hold them not long. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it ſhould bee ſo in religion. Our acknowledging of the truth is not ſo commendable, or bleſſed, as our deniall would bee ſhamefull, and curſed. But I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not ſo much to what purpoſe I ſpeake, as what our Euangeliſt directes mee to ſpeake: yet I could not but touch here by the way, though I bee bound for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place. Let it bee my fault, ſo it bee your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte.</p>
            <p>I come now to the amplification of the worlds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe, and ignorance, that it was made by our Lord and yet would not know him. Wherein (ere we med<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle with the matter, that is principally intended) wee muſt cleere this doubt, for the better vnderſtanding of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This ſcruple hath made diuers writers expound this whole verſe, of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge, which is to bee had, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Creatures. But there is no reaſon, to leaue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o many good proofes, as drawe vs the other way, to follow this one likelyhood, in ſo vncertaine a path; I might ſay, ſo ſtraying from the truth, which is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to all men. For out of queſtion (as it hath beene ſhewed) the world cannot iuſtly bee condemned, for not knowing GOD (becauſe indeede they did knowe him in the creatures) or for ignoraunce of the Meſſiah by thoſe meanes, which were neuer able, nor intended to giue knowledge of him. Therefore it
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21009:179"/> is agreeable to reaſon, and diuinitie, rather to ſeeke, how wee may aunſwere this doubt; then, becauſe of it, to forſake a manifeſt truth in expoſition. Firſt them, wee ſay, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> condemnes the world of ignorance, and vnkindneſſe, that they acknowledged not our Sauiour liuing amongſt them, &amp; conuerſing with them, though hee were indeede the verie maker of them, and author of their being. But you will aske me how they ſhould diſcerne any ſuch matter, by his carriage, and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the world. Therefore I aunſwere ſecondly to that point, wherein the whole cauſe of doubting lyes; that the miracles, which our Sauiour wrought, from time to time, in the ſight of all the world, were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofes, that hee could bee no other, but the great Commaunder of heauen and earth. Did hee not ouer rule the courſe of nature? Did hee not giue ſight, hearing, health, and life, by his bare worde? <hi>Damſell, I ſay vnto thee ariſe; and ſtraight way the</hi>

Who could worke ſuch wonders, but hee that had power, aboue, and againſt the courſe of nature? How could he by any meanes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſure them, that it was he, that made the world, then by taking the ſame courſe in changing nature, that hee had followed before in creating nature? <hi>God ſayd, let</hi>

            <p>Conſider then the ſlouthfull careleſneſſe, or the wonderfull blindneſſe of the worlde, that knewe not him that had made them. Why ſhould they be ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the vaine pleaſures, or toyleſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this life, as not to beſtowe ſome little time, in the conſideration of ſo ſtraunge, and admirable a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage?

            <p>But let the Tranſlation paſſe: the ſenſe of the wordes is more worth our labour. The Originall Greeke, and the vulgar Latine make difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the wordes, <hi>His owne,</hi> in the former, and the ſame in the later part of the verſe.

               </note> Latine chaungeth the word too, aſwell as the gender: Both the one, and the other direct vs to expound the firſt, of the place; and the laſt, of the perſons. Neither our tranſlation nor the Rhemiſts expreſſe this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>If they had added to their, <hi>into his owne, Countrey, or place,</hi> or ſome ſuch worde to make the Euangeliſts meaning more plaine, I would haue thought, they had rather indeauoured to bee vnderſtood, then ſtriuen to diſſent. Well, let vs then <hi>by his owne</hi> in the former clauſe, conceiue, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> notes the place, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Sauiour came. Thus remaines a great doubt, whether this place, bee the worlde in generall, or the Land of <hi>Iudea</hi> in particular. Not to trouble you with any long diſcourſe of this point, it ſeemes moſt likely to mee (with reuerence of other mens iudgement) that the holy Ghoſt in this verſe ſpeakes particularly of <hi>the Iewes.</hi> Of the worlds ignorance, and careleſneſſe in not taking knowledge of ſo rare, and extraordinarie a perſonage, hee had ſpoken in the former verſe: and amplyfied their ſin, by nothing, that he, whom they did not know, was their Creator; as the miracles, he wrought

            <p>
               <hi>His owne receiued him not,</hi> Perhaps not with ſuch ſignes of ioy, ſhewes of triumph, and ſignifications of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and ſubiection, as in ſuch a caſe it was fit, &amp; neceſſary, they ſhould haue done. There might haue bin ſome excuſe for them, if they had fayld in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his intertainement only. They were vnder the Romans gouernment, and durſt not be knowne of any other King they lookt for, till they might ſee him in the field with banners diſplayed, profeſſing himſelfe to bee in armes, for their deliuerance. But they would not at all receiue him. This behauiour cuts off al excuſe, and laies them open to a iuſt imputation of rebellion. But heere wee muſt firſt call to minde, that by <hi>His owne,</hi> not the place, as in the former part of the verſe, but the perſons, to whome he came, are ſignified. Secondly, let vs, in a word, or two, conſider their refuſall of him; What is meant by not receiuing him: why the holy Ghoſt vſeth this word of the Iewes, whereas he had ſaid no more of the world in generall, but that they knewe him not. <hi>The Iewes receiued him not.</hi> Did they not receiue him? They flockt after him, in multitudes; they came to him far, &amp; neere, to be cured by him, of al kind of diſeaſes: they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the power of God in his miracles; yea ſo highly did they eſteem of him, and ſo greatly affect him, <note place="margin">Ioh 6. 15.</note> that they would needs haue made him a king. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it ſaid, that they would not receiue him? To receiue a meſſenger, that comes from a Soueraigne Prince to his ſubiects, is not only to ſuffer him to come a-ſhore, to let him haue entraunce into the Citty, to entertaine him with good cheere, to Iodge him well, to giue him ſome preſent, to honour his perſon, but eſpecially to accept of his meſſage, and to performe that, which he requires
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:21009:185"/> of them, in his Lord, and maſters name. If they be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in theſe later duties, let the former be done in neuer ſo good ſort, they may iuſtly bee charg'd with not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing him, that comes. Shal I make it plaine by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the like nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt (as our Euangeliſt hath taught vs) <hi>was ſent to beare witneſſe of the light, that all by him might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi> Was he receiued by the Iewes, or no? If you looke to his outward entertainement, you ſhall find, that hee had all the kindneſſe ſhewed him, that hee woulde admitt of, and might haue had much more, but that he continually refuſed it. Neither was this from the teeth outward, in ſhewe without ſubſtance, but from the very affection of their heartes, which were ſette on him, ſo that hee might haue ledde them like children, whitherſoeuer hee woulde. But what ſay you to the ground of his meſſage, the ende of his embaſſage from God to them? Did they receiue him or no? Did they beleeue, by meanes of him? If they did not; howſoeuer they accounted of his perſon, they receiued him not. For the receiuing of him, was the entertaining of his meſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſage, that hee brought, by beleeuing that Chriſt was the light, and reſting vpon him to bee inlightned. It is not hard now to vnderſtand, what is meant, in this place, by not receiuing. And if it were; the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt makes it plaine, and eaſie in the next verſe; where <note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> hee expoundes receiuing to bee beleeuing in his name. So that not to <hi>receiue Chriſt,</hi> with which fault the Iewes heere are charged, is, not <hi>to beleeue in him.</hi> VVhat that is, I haue already ſhewed in parte, and muſt handle it againe, when I come to the expounding of thoſe wordes. In the meane while, lette vs holde this for a certaine truth, that <hi>to receiue Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>to beleeue in his name,</hi> and that the Iewes are challenged for not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing therein.</p>
            <pb n="367" facs="tcp:21009:185"/>
            <p>The world was accuſed of ignorance, by our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt. <hi>The worldknewe him not.</hi> The Iewes, his owne people, haue a farder matter layed to their charge, that <hi>They beleeued not in his name:</hi> whence ariſeth this difference? VVas it enough for the worlde to haue knowne him? VVere the Iewes free from ignorance of him? Neither of both. For they only haue the prerogatiue to bee the ſonnes of GOD, that beleeue in his name. The Deuills knewe him to bee <hi>the holy one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk 4. 34. Mark. 3. 11.</note> 
               <hi>of GOD; yea, the Sonne of GOD,</hi> and made open profeſſion of that their knowledge: as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> alſo <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 19.</note> teſtifies of them, <hi>They beleeue, and tremble,</hi> to their far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condemnation. And for the Iewes, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> giues this teſtimony of them, That, <hi>Hee knewe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 13. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>their betraying, and denying of Ieſus in the preſence of Pilat, their preferring a murderer before him, and their killing of the LORD of life, proceeded from ignorance both in the common ſorte, and in their gouernours.</hi> Then it coulde not haue auayled the Gentiles to haue knowne him, without they had alſo beleeued in him; and the Iewes not beleeuing, was of ignorance. Yet of the former the Euangeliſt ſaith, <hi>They knewe him not:</hi> of the later, <hi>They beleeued not in his name.</hi> In both, hee ſpeakes moſt wiſely, and fitly. The very firſt ſteppe to belieuing in Chriſt, is the acknowledging of him to be ſent from God. Of this, his many, and glorious miracles gaue ſo manifeſt, and certaine proofe, that the mouths of children were filled with his prayſes; <hi>Hoſanna to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 15. 16</note> 
               <hi>Sonne of Dauid.</hi> Therefore if the world would not take knowledge of our Sauiour, what excuſe remaines there for them? How can they bee charged with any leſſe? How could they be ignorant of ſo much?</p>
            <p>Now the Iews were faulty in an higher degree. They knewe of olde, that there was a deliuerer to come; that the time appointed for his commong was expired: they heard euery day the Sermons of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffected to him; but what is all this, if I know not how to make vſe of him, of his power, and skill, to mine own helpe? It is all one, as if I had a boxe of moſt precious oyntment in my hand, which I knew to bee very ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, but vnderſtood not how it is to be applyed. To ſhut out this excuſe, remember what <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was. <hi>He was ſent to beare witnes of the light, that all men through him might beleeue.</hi> Cal to minde how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 7. Act. 19. 4.</note> he demean'd himſelfe in it. <hi>Iohn verily baptized with the baptiſme of repentance, ſaying vnto the people, that they ſhould beleeue in him, which ſhould come after him, that is in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This being the eſtate of matters among the Iewes, while our Lorde was here vpon the earth, were they not iuſtly to be blam'd, for not beleeuing? Or could they plead ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for excuſe? It is true indeed, that they knewe him not to bee the Lorde of life. But this ignorance proceeded of wilfulneſſe, and preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. What can they ſay for themſelues? Did they not knowe, ſuch an one was to come? They had it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their mouths; it was the hope of their life, the ioy of their heart, the glory of their nation, whereof they were not a little proude. But they knewe not, that this was hee. But they might haue done: nay, they could not haue choſen but haue knowne, if they had not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhutte their eies againſt the light of his miracles, and ſtopt their eares againſt <hi>Iohns</hi> teſtimony of him. Therefore doth our Euangeliſt, worthily charge them with not <hi>beleeuing in his name,</hi> whom <hi>Iohn</hi> teſtified
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:21009:186"/> and his owne works declared to be the Sauiour, that was promiſed to <hi>Iſraell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the point, that the Euangeliſt offers to our conſideration in theſe wordes; that <hi>the Iewes, beeing the peculiar people of GOD, to whome the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that was to bee wrought by the Meſſiah, firſt and principally appertained, refuſed to accept him for their Sauiour:</hi> It were infinite almoſt, I will not ſay to ſet out, but to ſet downe the ſeuerall iniuries, they did him, the indignities they offered him, through the whole courſe of his life, and miniſterie amongſt them. His daily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of miracles was imputed to vaine glorie, as if hee ſought by them to make himſelfe famous in the eies of the world. This vile conceite, his owne kinſmen had of him. <hi>Depart hence</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and goe into Iudea,</hi>

            <p>But I will not preſſe theſe things too farre, becauſe they are a degree beyond the <hi>not receiuing of him,</hi> whereof the Text ſpeakes.

But this belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing was a matter of very great importance; becauſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it depended all hope of deliuerance, by the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah. All diſobedience, and ſinne, is liable to damnation, but yet there is poſſibilitie of forgiueneſs, though the tranſgreſſion bee exceeding great. Onely this one ſinne, of not beleeuing, makes a man vtterly vncapable of any <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 29.</note> fauour, as long as hee continues in it.

In the handling of them, I will keepe mine ordinarie courſe; Firſt to ſpeake of the wordes, as neede requires: then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the Euangeliſts meaning.</p>
            <p>Concerning the wordes, I am in the firſt place, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the tranſlation of ſome of them: Secondly to ſearch out their ſignification. The tranſlation, that affords ſome cauſe of doubt, is of two words in the middle of the verſe, <hi>Prerogatiue,</hi> and <hi>to bee.</hi> Not Prerogatiue, ſay our <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> but <hi>Power;</hi> not <hi>to bee,</hi> but <hi>to bee made:</hi> and vpon theſe wordes ſo interpreted, they build the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of free will. Beſides theſe two, there are alſo two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other wordes, which are ſomewhat doubtfull for their ſignifications, in the later part of the verſe. What it is <hi>To beleeue</hi> in; what is meant by <hi>his name.</hi> For the better conceiuing of the Euangeliſts meaning, I will firſt inquire, how theſe verſes depend vpon the former: Secondly, what it is, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would teach vs by them.</p>
            <p>Of tranſlations a man may ſay, as of potions: that if they bee not carefully, and faithfully prepared, they may kill, in ſtead of curing. For although ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, a man of a ſtrong conſtitution, by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of nature, ouercomes the danger of ſuch an accident: yet where one eſcapeth, many periſh.

               </gap>falls out ſo in erronious tranſlations: ſome by skill in the Originall,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:21009:188"/> can correct the error, when they reade; other (though but a few) diſcerning ſome contrarietie, betwixt ſome one or two places, and the generall courſe, that is helde in the ſcripture, can with wiſdome reiect that, which with reaſon they cannot receiue. Thoſe, whom God wil haue eſpecially preſerued, haue alſo a farder teaching of the ſpirit, by which they are kept from approbation of that, which might ouerthrow their beliefe and ſaluation. All theſe are but a ſmall number in compariſon of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them, who like fiſhes ſwallow vp the hooke with the baite, and feede on Rats-bane, as if it were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Vpon ſuch our <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> ordinarily worke, by that corrupt, and poiſon-full tranſlation of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; wherein, either they take aduantage of former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, where they finde any, to continue them, or if they find none, breed ſome. The vulgar Latin, and our old Engliſh tranſlation, before that, which was printed at <hi>Geneua,</hi> expreſſe the worde, that our Euangeliſt here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, by <hi>Poteſtatem, Power.</hi> This interpretation the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> willingly embrace, &amp; thruſt it vpon their followers, and commend it to all that will beleeue them, that they may thereby lay a foundation for free will to ſtand vpon.</p>
            <p>Neither are they contented heerewithall: but in the ſecond edition of their ſaid Teſtament, printed at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerpe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Anno 1600.</note> after their returne to <hi>Doway,</hi> they condemne the Truth, to eſtabliſh their Error. For in the margin, at this verſe, thus they write. <hi>Bezafalſely tranſlateth dignitatem, for potestatem.</hi> I wonder, and can not certainely reſolue, what the reaſon ſhould bee, why theſe Engliſh Papiſts, ſhould forbeare to finde fault with our Engliſh later tranſlations and laſh out ſo againſt <hi>Beza.</hi> He tranſlates <hi>Dignitatem, we prerogatiue.</hi> Doth it more concerne your ignorant Lay Engliſh, to know what is amiſſe in <hi>Beza,</hi> whome ſome of them (perhaps) neuer heard of, fewe of them are able to vnderſtand, none of them almoſt will vouchſafe to reade, or may without leaue, then to be
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:21009:189"/> taught, what is faulty in the Engliſh, which is in euery mans hand, and ſight? But Proteſtants make great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Bezas</hi> tranſlation. And great cauſe they haue ſo to doe. For although it bewray the infirmitie of man in ſome places; yet it hath brought exceeding great light, to the true vnderſtanding of the Scripture. Could you hope that any Proteſtant, woulde bee ſo ſimple, as to condemne a man ſo famous in the Church of GOD for his learning, and pietie, vpon the bare word of a few Popiſh Prieſts? They, that are able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter, will cleere him, and caſt you. They that haue no ſuch skill, muſt needes bee voide, not of grace onely, but of reaſon too, if they will bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, againſt the truth commonly helde in all proteſtant Churches, by a ſimple affirmation of men, whome they know not, who neither can, nor offer to bring any proofe of that, which they confidently auouch.</p>

If our Lord had meant to ſhew his free will in this caſe, either hee woulde haue made no mention at all of any Commandement; or at leaſt, hee would haue ſaid, that his Father had giuen him Commandement, to doe what hee liſt in the matter; eyther to die, or not to die; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to liue againe, or not to liue againe. And yet, to ſay the truth, I doe not ſee what reaſon there is in ſuch a ſpeech; I haue commandement to doe what I liſt: Nay rather I haue libertie, or at the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>Let vs examine the matter, ſomwhat more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly. Is it true, that our Sauiour CHRIST had ſuch libertie, as, vpon this grant of free will, muſt needes inſue? I will not aske, how it can ſtand with the commandement, hee names; that was toucht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Was it in his choiſe, whether he would die or no? And when he was dead, whether he would liue againe or no? I ſuppoſe, no man will bee haſtie to affirme the later, whatſoeuer hee may imagine of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oucheth in plaine <note place="margin">Act. 2. 24.</note> tearmes, that it <hi>was vnpoſſible hee ſhould bee held by Death.</hi> Nether was there leſſe neceſſitie of his death, then of his Reſurrection (I ſpeake of both in reſpect of the euent). And therefore himſelfe tells the two <note place="margin">Luke 24. 26.</note> Diſciples; <hi>that it could not bee, but that he muſt haue ſuffred ſuch things;</hi> which hee confirmes afterward to all the Diſciples, ſomwhat more generally: <hi>Theſe are the wordes</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>which I ſpake vnto you, while I was yet with you, that all must bee fulfilled, which is written of mee in the Lawe of Moſes, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and in the Pſalmes.</hi> But the handling of this point belongs to an other place; thus much by the way. It will bee obiected perhaps, that the former part of our Lords ſpeech ſeemes to prooue, that hee ſpeakes of the freedome of his will, becauſe hee ſaith,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:21009:192"/> that <hi>No man takes his life from him, but hee layes it downe of himſelfe:</hi> whereas if he had not his choiſe, whether hee would die or no; his life were taken from him, and not not laide downe by himſelfe. But who ſees not, that our Sauiour ſpeakes of the malice, and craft of men, which hee could eaſily haue withſtood, or preuented, by many meanes, but that hee had vndertaken to yeelde himſelfe into their hands. That power remained ſtill in him, by which hee could haue defeated them of their purpoſe, and preſerued his owne life, had hee not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly made himſelfe ſubiect vnto death. Yet I deny not, but it was free for him, in regard of the nature of his will, which was not altered, or forced, nor can bee, to die or not to die: But (in the euent) it could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fall out, that hee ſhould eſcape. But of this place enough.</p>
            <p>There is an other, in this ſame Goſpell of the like nature; where Pilat, at the arraignement of our Lord, ſaith thus to him; <hi>Knowest thou not, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to looſe thee?</hi> Doth Pilat meane <note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 10.</note> hee had <hi>freewill?</hi> No ſuch matter: But that he had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie, and that it lay in his hands, to acquite, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him. This, our Sauiours anſwere ſhewes; <hi>Thou couldeſt haue no power ouer mee</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>except it were giuen thee from aboue.</hi> Our Lord doth not meane, that hee could not haue freewill in this caſe, vnleſſe hee had it from God; but that himſelfe, had neuer bin at <hi>Pilats</hi> diſpoſition, except God had before hand ſo appointed, to deliuer him into his hands. This is that which the Apoſtles profeſſe in their Sermon to the Iewes, <hi>that hee was deliuered, by the determinate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>counſaile, and foreknowledge of GOD.</hi> Which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is repeated in their praier, &amp; ſpeciall mention made of <hi>Pilat, Herod, the Gentiles, and the Iewes;</hi> who are ſaid <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 27. 28.</note> 
               <hi>to haue gathered themſelues together againſt Ieſus, To doe whatſoeuer the hand, and the Counſell of GOD</hi>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:21009:192"/> 
               <hi>had determined before to bee done.</hi> What reaſon is there then, to vnderſtand the worde in this place, of <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the booke of the Acts, there are two texts, that ſeeme to leane this way, toward <hi>freewill,</hi> ſignified by the worde heere vſed. <hi>It is not for you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to know the times or the ſeaſons, which the father, hath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>put in his owne power:</hi> How hath the father put the times, or ſeaſons in his power, but by reſeruing all Autoritie to himſelfe, to appoint them, according to his owne will, and to giue men ſuch notice of them, as hee thinkes good? But the other place is ſomwhat harder. <hi>Ananias</hi> (you know the ſtory) hauing ſold a poſſeſſion, kept away part of the money, for which he had ſold it, and brought a certaine part to the Apoſtles, making ſhew, as if that had bin all, that hee receiued for it. <hi>Peter</hi> reprouing him for this grieuous hypocriſie, reaſons thus with him; <hi>whiles it remained, appertained it not to thee? And after it was ſolde, was it not in thine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4</note> 
               <hi>owne power?</hi> Heere, by <hi>Power</hi> the Apoſtle may ſeeme to note, that it was in his owne choiſe, to diſpoſe of it, as pleaſed him. And ſurely this followes vpon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpeech. But the worde rather ſignifies, that hee had full autoritie ouer it, as were after the ſale, as before, to doe what he would withall. Was it not in thy hand? Mighteſt thou not lawfully haue retayned the whole ſumme? For if we vnderſtand the ſpeech of his free will, ſo hee may bee ſaid to haue it in his power, though it had bin due to the maintenance of the poore? But the Apoſtle would ſhewe him, that there was no reaſonable excuſe for his ſinne; becauſe it was not a matter, that lay vppon him by any Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, or lawe: but a thing that proceeded from his owne choiſe, whereas lawfully hee might haue done otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principall places, and in a manner
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:21009:193"/> all of them, which (as farre as I am able to diſcerne) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aue any reaſonable ſhew of proofe that the word may bee taken for freedome of will. As for a fewe other in the former Epiſtle to the Corinthians, it is no hard matter to anſwere them in a worde. Firſt, where the Apoſtle ſpeakes of a mans <hi>hauing power ouer his owne</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 37.</note> 
               <hi>will,</hi> it is plaine hee meanes not free will, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer that freedome, by which a man hath liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to keepe or not to keepe his virgin. So that this power determines, and as it were ties the will to the one onely; as the wordes before declare, where he ſpeakes of <hi>being firme in his heart;</hi> that is as it followeth in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verſe, <hi>hauing decreed in his heart, that hee will keepe his virgin.</hi> In the ninth Chapter, there is often mention of power to <hi>eate, power to leade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a wife, power not to labour, with hands; power to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 9. 4. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>partake of their goods, to whome they preach.</hi> What is this els, but a lawfull Autoritie to doe, or not doe theſe things, as in ſpirituall diſcretion, they ſhall think moſt fit, for the edifying of their brethren? Now all, that hath bin ſaid, beeing conſidered: I thinke I may ſafely conclude, that the worde, which our <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> tranſlate power, vnderſtanding by it <hi>free will,</hi> may well bee expounded <hi>Dignitie,</hi> or <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue</hi> in this Text; and is neuer ſo vſed in any part of the new Teſtament, that it muſt needs be taken for <hi>freewill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the other worde, the tranſlation and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof I am now to ſearch out, I can not ſay ſo: becauſe there are many places, where it can not ſtand for <hi>to bee,</hi> but of neceſſitie muſt bee taken for <hi>to bee made.</hi> It is enough to iuſtifie our tranſlation, ſo farre as concernes the nature of the worde it ſelfe, that it ſignifyeth, and that often, in the Scripture, yea ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, <hi>to bee;</hi> as we in this place tranſlate it. I wittingly, and willingly forbeare to alledge any proofe of that, I
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:21009:193"/> ſay, by bringing examples; becauſe it is knowne, and acknowledged by all, that haue any little skill of the Greeke tongue. But ſince both may be, what reaſon can we bring, why our <hi>to bee</hi> ſhould be preferred, before the Papiſts <hi>to bee made?</hi> Firſt it is certaine, that all they, which expound the former, by dignitie, excellencie, and ſuch like, vnderſtand by this later, a preſent poſſeſſion of Son-ſhip (if I may ſo ſpeake) and not a future poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Secondly, they alſo, that by it, will haue autoritie, or right to be meant, generally are of opinion, that they, of whome our Euangeliſt heere ſpeakes, are actually, and in their preſent eſtate, ſonnes of God, by that grace, which is ſignified in the other word, though ſome thinke it may bee loſt afterward. Onely <hi>Maldonat</hi> the Ieſuite, fearing, as it may well be thought, leaſt he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for an heritike, as he was ſomtimes accuſed to bee; though he confeſſe, that by the former worde, <hi>right</hi> is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; yet he will not at any hand, agree with vs, about this latter point; but chooſeth rather to allow of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expoſition; and that none of the beſt, neither. <hi>To them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maldonat) that were already truely, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede</hi>

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:21009:194"/> choiſe of that worde, that is proper to that dignitie, and intereſt.</p>
            <p>But let the Euangeliſt declare his owne meaning. What can bee more plaine, then that, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the next verſe; <hi>which are borne not of bloud, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> They, that beleeue in the name of Chriſt, are borne of God: Therefore <hi>are</hi> they ſonnes, not onely haue Power, Autoritie, or Right to bee; as if they were not ſo vpon their beeleeuing, but muſt procure that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in time, I know not when, by a ſecond grace, to bee purchaſt by the good vſe of the former. The Scripture deliuereth an other manner of Doctrine, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs, that all, euen as many as beleeue in Chriſt, according to the Goſpell, are the ſonnes of God by faith. <hi>Yee are all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galathians)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 26.</note> 
               <hi>the Sonnes of GOD by faith in CHRIST.</hi> Nay (ſay our Papiſts) not by faith, but by charitie. Faith indeede giues vs a certaine right, that we may become the ſonnes of God; but it is charitie, by which wee at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine to this honour. As if our loue to God proceeded not from that ſpirit of his, by which wee receiued faith, and which teacheth, and ſtirreth vs vp to call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Becauſe ye are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the Spirit</hi>

               <hi>of his Sonne into your hearts, which cryeth Abba Father.</hi> See I pray you; if there bee any difference of times in theſe matters, wee are ſonnes, ere wee haue this ſpirit of loue. And why, or how, doe wee, or can wee loue God, but in reſpect of his fatherly kindneſs to vs in Ieſus Chriſt? we loue, becauſe we are ſonnes; we are not made ſonnes, becauſe wee loue firſt. But I may not wade too farre in this matter, which appertaines to the Doctrine heere deliuered; whereas I am yet, but in ſearch for the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the words. Wherein wee haue found two things, that wee lookt for; and lighted vpon a third by occaſion. Firſt, the worde vſed by our Euangeliſt, &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated by our <hi>Rhemiſts, Power,</hi> doth not ſignifie <hi>free will,</hi>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:21009:194"/> but <hi>dignity,</hi> or <hi>prerogatiue.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the other word notes our preſent eſtate vpon beleefe, that <hi>we are the Sonnes of God;</hi> not our poſſibility, that <hi>we may be,</hi> if we vſe the grace we haue receiued, well. In this ſearch, the word Sonne, offered it ſelfe to vs in its own proper ſignification, not vſurping the place of his brother heire.</p>
            <p>We are now to go forward, in the like examination of two other wordes, or rather phraſes: and to enquire, what it is to <hi>beleeue</hi> in this, or that, and ſo <hi>To beleeue in Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, what is meant by <hi>Beleeuing in his name;</hi> whether it bee all one with <hi>Beleeuing in him,</hi> or no. Now of the former I ſhall need to ſay the leſſe, becauſe I ſpake of it ſomewhat largely, vpon the firſt occaſion, that offered it ſelfe, in this Goſpel at the ſeauenth verſe. <hi>That all men through him might beleeue.</hi> The breefe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Verſe. 7.</note> that, which then was deliuered, touching this point, is this; that <hi>To beleeue,</hi> is an action, either of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or of the will. The former, that is, <hi>Beleeuing</hi> as it hath place in the vnderſtanding, is either an hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome point, as a truth ingraffed in vs by nature; as, <hi>wee beleeue there is a God:</hi> or an aſſenting to ſome thing reuealed, vpon the credit of him, that reueales it; as, <hi>wee acknowledge the Scripture to be the worde of God, and euery thing in it, to be ſure, and certaine;</hi> according as wee are perſwaded by the holy Ghoſt, to whome wee giue abſolute credit, vpon his owne worde. The other <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,</hi> which is ſeated in the will, and ariſeth from the former in the vnderſtanding, is a reſting vpon, or truſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to ſome perſon, or thing, for ſome benefit to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereby.

But the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell would not truſt to him, or rely on him for food, in the wilderneſſe; <hi>Therefore fire was kindled in Iacob.</hi> (as it is in the Pſalme) <hi>and alſo wrath came vpon</hi>

               <hi>Iſraell; Becauſe they beleeued not in God, and truſted not in his helpe.</hi> Of this nature, and meaning, is the worde <hi>Beleeuing,</hi> when it concernes iuſtification, or ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This may eaſily appeare by thoſe kinde of phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that the holy Ghoſt often vſeth in this matter; <hi>To beleeue in,</hi> or <hi>vpon God, and Chriſt.

            <p>It will not be amiſſe perhaps to make it plaine by an example or two; Firſt what is ſimply to beleeue, in <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 7.</note> this caſe? <hi>Iohn was ſent to beare witneſſe, that all through him might beleeue.</hi> What beleefe was it, that <hi>Iohn</hi> taught?

               <hi>which ſhould come after him, that is in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Do you not ſee, that vnder the bare word, <hi>beleeuing,</hi> faith in Chriſt is implyed? Sometimes there is a little addition; as <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid <hi>not only to haue beleeued,</hi> but <hi>to haue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>beleeued God.</hi> How doth the Apoſtle expound this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe? <hi>By beleeuing on or vpon God.</hi> What is that elſe, but <note place="margin">Verſe. 5.</note> reſting vpon God?

               <hi>beleeueth theron ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> How is this ſtone to be beleeued on? but by a mans ſetling, and repoſing himſelfe there vpon? Therefore the Hebrew in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <note place="margin">Iſai. 28. 26.</note> is, <hi>ſhall not make haſte:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid; ſhall
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:21009:195"/> caſt himſelfe vpon God to be ſuccoured by him, and wait with patience, for the performance of his gratious promiſe. The greeke expreſſeth the euent, that ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue vpon this beleeuing, by a denyall of the contrary, ſet out to our view by a tropicall ſpeech of being a ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For he, that lookes for ſuccour, and by fayling of it is ouerthrowne, vſually is aſhamed both of his truſt, &amp; of his foile. So ſhall not he be, ſaith the Lord, that reſteth vpon Ieſus Chriſt, as vpon the rock of ſaluation. This alſo the <hi>Chalde paraphraſe</hi> expreſſeth; <hi>ſhall not be moued:</hi>

            <p>But you will ſay, There are diuers places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where that faith, by which wee are iuſtified, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>body, not to haue doubted of the promiſe of God, through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe &amp;c.</hi> Then this faith, or beleeuing is expreſt, <hi>to haue beene a full aſſurance, that he, which had promiſed, was</hi>

So in the Epiſtle to <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 3.</note> the Hebrewes, wee are ſaid by faith to <hi>vnderſtand, that the world was ordained by the word of God:</hi> and yet all men graunt, as alſo the former Chapter euidently ſheweth, <note place="margin">Chap. 10. 38. 39</note> that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſuch a faith, as the iuſt liue by. It is not my purpoſe to enter into a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or diſcourſe of faith: which I reſerue for my expoſition of the Epiſtle to the Romans; yet I
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:21009:196"/> may not leaue theſe doubts vnſatisfied, nor the nature of faith vnknowne. Therefore, to theſe, and ſuch like places of Scripture, and obiections from them, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, firſt in generall, that beleeuing (as it belongs to the vnderſtanding) is ſometimes mentioned alone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the roote, and fountaine from which the other doth ſpring, and flow. For it is vnpoſſible, that any man ſhould rely vpon God, for the performance of that, which he doth not beleeue he hath promiſed, or doubts whether he be able to doe, or no. Yea, I ſay farder, that ſuch a beleefe in the minde is ſignified in all ſuch places, as is alwaies neceſſarily accompanied with truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, for that, which wee beleeue, hee can bring to paſſe. If you demaund farder, why I ſhould not content my ſelfe with the former faith only, ſeeing it is (diuers times) ſet alone in the point of Iuſtification; I anſwere, that therefore I take the other alſo to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in it, becauſe I find it very often expreſt in the Scripture; and a new kind of ſpeech, as it were purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuiſed by the holy Ghoſt, to make vs the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fully vnderſtand, what faith hee meanes, in the matter of our iuſtification.</p>

It cannot bee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but that the holy Ghoſt, by this new kind of ſpeech notes ſomewhat more, then ſimply <hi>to aſſent to the truth of God, vpon the autority of the ſpeaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In particular I ſay farder, touching that of <hi>Abraham;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.</note> firſt that his <hi>beleeuing</hi> (as we haue often heard) is a <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in God,</hi> or <hi>reſting vpon God.</hi> 2, that <hi>beleeuing</hi> could not haue profited Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he had only acknowledgd the truth of that, which God promiſed, and not truſted to him, for the performance thereof. What can it auaile any man to Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he holds IESVS CHRIST to be the only Sauiour, and faith in himt he only means of ſaluation, if he doe not withall rely vpon him, to bee ſaued by his mediation? Thirdly, it muſt bee conſidered, that the Apoſtle, applying that particular of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to all beleeuers; expoundeth that <hi>beleeuing,</hi> by relying vpon God. <hi>Which beleeue on him, that raiſed vp Ieſus our Lorde from the dead.</hi> What is it (think you) <hi>to beleeue on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe 24.</note> 
               <hi>him, that raiſed Ieſus?</hi> To aſſent to the truth of Scripture, that tells vs, he was raiſed? Then ſhould the Apoſtle ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, <hi>which beleeue God, who ſaith he hath</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:21009:197"/> 
               <hi>raiſed him.</hi> But it is required, that wee <hi>beleeue on him;</hi> and there is no ſpeech, nor thought of any thing affirmed by God, which wee ſhould beleeue. Let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus; <hi>which beleeue, that God raiſed Ieſus.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely if this had beene the Apoſtles meaning, hee would neuer haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo doubtfully, of ſo weighty a matter, where he had a plaine, and eaſy ſpeech to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that, which he intended, to the vnderſtanding of euery man; whereas no man woulde euer conceiue what he meant, by theſe wordes, if they ſignified no more, but giuing credit to the truth of our Sauiors reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>As for the other place out of the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, what can poſſibly bee concluded out of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 7.</note> that, I haue deliuered, touching the nature of that faith, by which we are iuſtified? What, if by it we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>that the world was ordained of GOD?</hi> Is this all, that is required to the iuſtifying of a man, in reſpect of faith? There is no ſuch thing, either expreſt, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the words. Nay rather, all the examples, that follow, are ſo many proofes, that the faith, whereof the holy Ghoſt there ſpeakes, can not bee ſeuered from be leeuing in God. I will not ſtand vpon the particulars at this time; the later part of the next Chapter before, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion whereof the Apoſtle falles into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of faith, giues ſentence for me. <hi>The iuſt ſhall liue</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 10. 38. 37.</note> 
               <hi>by faith.</hi> By what faith? by that, which only giues credit to the truth of God? No but by ſuch a faith, as makes vs reſt vpon God, for the performance of his promiſe: which preſuppoſeth the truth thereof. How chance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Apoſtle in ſetting forth the nature of faith, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes ſuch effects therevnto, as may bee without any reſting vpon God? Shall wee ſay, that this faith ſpreds it ſelfe ouer the whole ſoule, and is ſeated aſwell in the vnderſtanding, as in the affection? I ſee not how it can ſtand with reaſon, to place any habit, or quality in two
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:21009:197"/> diuers partes, or faculties of the ſoule. VVhat then? Is not beleeuing of the truth required to iuſtification? Yes ſurely: There is no poſſibility of ſaluation, without it. For how ſhall any man truſt in Chriſt, to be iuſtified by him, it hee doe not beleeue, that hee is appointed by God, to be a Sauiour of all them, that truſt vnto him? But the queſtion is; firſt, whether <hi>Beleefe bee nothing elſe but an aſſenting to the truth;</hi> Secondly, whether <hi>the true nature of that faith, which is availeable to our iuſtification, conſiſt in resting vpon Chriſt, to be iuſtified by him, or no:</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is required, as the roote and foundation; but the very forme of iuſtifying faith, is beleeuing in Chriſt; as it ſhall appeare (I hope) when I haue iuſt occaſion to define it, and handle it at large. In the meane while, that no man may bee troubled about that place to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, let vs remember, that the Apoſtle being to ſette forth iuſtifying faith, and to perſwade continuance in obedience therevnto, enters into a commendation of fayth in generall, for the amply fying of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>But for the ſettling of our minds in the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that beleefe, which is required to our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing (I take it) can be of greater force, then the conſideration of the worde, as it is vſed (ordinarily) in the olde Teſtament. VVhen any bleſſing is to bee receined from God, what <hi>beleefe</hi> is it, that the Lorde expecteth of his people, to the ende, they may haue his protection, and aſſiſtance? A fewe examples will ſhew the nature of it. Becauſe <hi>thou haſt rested on the king of Aram, and haſt not reſted vpon the Lorde thy God, therefore is the hoaſt of the king of Aram eſcaped out of thy</hi>

               <hi>hands.</hi> Thus did <hi>Hanani</hi> the Seer reprooue <hi>Asa</hi> king of Iuda, ſhewing him that the reaſon, why hee preuail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not againſt the <hi>Aramites,</hi> was his <hi>not truſting in God.</hi> The ſame point hee amplifyed in the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:21009:198"/> 
               <hi>The Aethiopians</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the Lybians, were</hi>

               <hi>they not a great hoast, with Charrets, &amp; horſ-men exceeding many? Yet becauſe thou didſt reſt on the Lorde, he deliuered them into thy hand.</hi> Therefore doth <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> exhort his people to the like truſt in God, and aſſureth them of deliuerance from their enimies therevpon. <hi>Put your truſt on the Lord your God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and yee ſhall be aſſured.</hi>

               <hi>truſt in him. Yea,</hi> with ſuch a bleſſedneſſe, as ſhal neuer fayle them. <hi>They, that truſt in the Lord, ſhall bee as mount</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 8.</note> 
               <hi>bleſſed is the man, that truſteth in him: Such a man will not be afrayd of euill tidings; his heart is fixed, and beleeueth in the Lord.</hi> This is to beleeue to ſaluation, euen to haue his heart ſettled, and to repoſe himſelf wholly, and only <note place="margin">Pſ. 112 7. Act. 16. 31.</note> vpon Ieſus Chriſt. As for that perſwaſion, which euery man muſt haue, and wherein ſome woulde haue faith conſiſt; it followes him, that is iuſtified, and goes not before any mans iuſtification; as faith muſt needes doe: for the condition, to be performed on our part, to iuſtification, is to <hi>Beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, to <hi>beleeue in Chriſt,</hi> is to reſt vpon Chriſt: but what is it <hi>To beleeue in his name?</hi> Muſt his name bee reſted vpon, as if there were ſome eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall vertue in it? In which of his names? In IESVS, or in CHRIST? For of <hi>Imanuell</hi> it is needleſſe to ſay any thing, becauſe hee is not once ſo called in all this Goſpell; and if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt ſpeake of a name, doubtleſſe hee ſpeakes of ſuch a name, as was knowne and ordinary: neither woulde hee haue omitted it in
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21009:198"/> the hiſtory, if it had beene of ſuch importance, and vſe. It may ſeeme perhaps, that Ieſus is the name, in which all men, that will be ſaued muſt beleeue. For that is it, by which Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> commonly calls our Lord in his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; and by which he was well knowne amongſt men, as hauing beene giuen him, at the time of his circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 21.</note> and continued, according to the cuſtome of the Iewes. <hi>We haue found him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Nathaneel) of</hi>

               <hi>whome Moſes did write in the law, and of whome the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets writ; Ieſus the Sonne of Ioſeph.</hi> And of this name Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, many excellent things are ſpoken in the Scripture. <hi>That</hi> is ſaid to haue <hi>cured the man, that had beene a cripple</hi>

               <hi>from his mothers wombe. At that name, euen at the name of Ieſus, muſt euery knee bow: By that name wonders haue beene</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>wrought, according as the Apoſtles prayed to God, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſignes. and wonders might be done, by the name of his</hi>

               <hi>holy Sonne Ieſus.</hi> Neither is this name effectuall for bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cures only, but (as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> 
               <hi>There is giuen no other name vnder heauen, by which we muſt be ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is there indeed ſuch power in the name? What then needed our Lord to haue come himſelf in the fleſh? ſeeing there were more then one of that name, many yeeres, before he was conceiued in the wombe of the bleſſed virgin in his mother. Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Ioſedec</hi> is <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 12.</note> famous in <hi>Hagge,</hi> being high Prieſt after the peoples return out of the Captiuity. But much more famous was <note place="margin">oſua. 1. 1. 2. 3.</note> the other Ieſus, who brought the people of Iſraell into the Land of Canaan, and diuided to euery Tribe his proper in heritance. That the names are all one, though ſome would make a curious, and an idle diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, both the nature of the wordes ſhewe, and the holy Goſt in the new teſtament hath made it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, by calling <hi>Ioſua,</hi> Ieſus, without any kind of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the name. <hi>If Ieſus had giuen them reſt.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 8.</note> the Apoſtle in the ſame Chapter, hauing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

But it is plaine in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Greeke, and in the Syriake, and Latine tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as alſo in our Engliſh, that there is none. The 70. Iewes, that turned the olde Teſtament out of Hebrew into Greeke, ſo expreſt the names both of that Leader, and of the high Prieſt. Ioſua. 1. 1. <hi>Nowe after the death of</hi> Moſes <hi>the ſeruant of the Lord, the Lord ſpake vnto</hi> Ioſhua <hi>(Ieſus</hi> ſayeth the Greeke) and ſo through out that whole booke.

If the name giuen to our Sauiour Chriſt, by Gods owne appointment, had been diuers from the other; ſurely the holy Ghoſt would not haue confounded them But now of purpoſe the ſame is retained, that all men might vnderſtand the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it; as it is partly ſignified, in that place to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, concerning another <hi>Rest,</hi> into which Ieſus Chriſt hath brought the people of Iſraell, the true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.

            </p>
            <p>What ſhould I trouble you with many wordes, of this matter? By the name, the partie, whoſe name it is, is ſignifyed. Let the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expound himſelfe. <hi>His name hath made this man ſound, through faith in his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>name.</hi> Is it the name, or faith in the name Ieſus; and not rather Ieſus himſelfe, and faith in him? <hi>And the faith which is by him</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle) <hi>hath giuen him his perfect health.</hi> The like wee haue touchinge
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:21009:199"/> the ſame matter, in the next Chapter; <hi>By the name of Ieſus Chriſt of Nazareth, by him doth this man ſtand heer</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>before you whole.</hi> This ſheweth that the Miracles, which were wrought, proceeded from the power of Chriſt, not from any vertue in his name. How then ſhould ſaluation come from, or by it? Hearken what the Angell ſayth when hee giues the name. <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>call his name, Ieſus; for he ſhall ſaue his people, from their ſinnes.</hi> Not his name, but <hi>Hee.</hi> For the name had neither bloud, nor life to giue in ſacrifice: without which there is no forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to bee had. <note place="margin">Heb. 9 22. Phil. 2. 10.</note> Neither is that honour, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, to bee giuen to the name, as if the ſound of thoſe letters, ſo ſet together, deſerued any ſpeciall reuerence; or as if Ieſus were of more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt. For (as I ſayd once before) then ought wee to eſteeme the name of Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> and of the other Ieſus, the ſonne of <hi>Ioſedeck,</hi> more then of Chriſt the ſonne of God. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any name require bowing of the knee, it is that which God gaue himſelfe, euen <hi>Iehouah,</hi> and the other of the ſame kind, <hi>Eheieh,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iah.</hi> But the perſon is meant, when the name is mentioned: and the office of being a Sauiour is that, to which all honour is due in heauen, and in earth, and vnder the earth, by Angels, and men; not the Name of ſauing, which was common to our Lord, with other men.</p>
            <p>Why then doth the Euangeliſt vſe this kinde of ſpeech, <hi>To beleeue in his name?</hi> would hee thereby note our Lords power; vpon which euery one, that will bee ſaued muſt reſt, that hee may bee deliuered out of the handes of ſinne, and death? This may ſeeme the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, becauſe that miracle of curing the cripple was wrought by the name of our Lord. <hi>In the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:21009:200"/> rather perſwade my ſelfe, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> followes the Hebrewe phraſe, by which (ordinarily) the name is vſed, for the perſon. <hi>Ahraham called on the name of the</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iſay. 50. 10.</note> (ſayth the Prophet <hi>Iſay) truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay vpon his God.</hi> The later expounds the former. <hi>To trust in the name of God,</hi> is nothing elſe, but <hi>to ſtay or rest vpon God.</hi> So that the name of God, and God himſelfe ſignifie both one thing. His name alſo is often put for his worſhippe; as when the Prieſts are ſayd, <hi>to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the name of the Lord,</hi> the meaning is, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane his worſhip, as a matter of no worth. But this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee intended by the Euangeliſt.</p>
            <p>For the better vnderſtanding of whoſe meaning, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the expoſition of the words, wee muſt conſider how this verſe dependes vpon the former; which wee may thus reaſonably conceiue: The Euangeliſt, in the next wordes before, ſhewed the vnkindneſſe, and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the Iewes, in refuſing him, that made offer of himſelfe vnto them. <hi>His own receiued him not.</hi> A ſtrange vnkindneſſe, that a man ſo full of grace, and power, ſo holy in his life, ſo gratious in his words, ſo mighty in his deedes, and that to the benefit of them, among whome heeliued, ſhould notwithſtanding all this, bee ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily reiected. But was this all? I grant it is not nothing, to bee iuſtly condemned of ſuch vnciuill, and vnnaturall dealing. But there is worſe behind, to ſhew the folly of theſe men, in being occaſion to themſelues of ſo great a loſſe. If an olde man of fayre lands, and great wealth, ſhould ſeeke to bee intertained of his neer kinſmen, or friends, and not bee receiued, would not all
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:21009:200"/> the world charge them with extraordinary vnkindnes, and condemne them of ſingular folly, for depriuing themſelues of ſo goodly an inheritance, and ſo great an eſtate, as they wereſure to haue enioyed, by receiuing of him? Such was the caſe, in the Iewes refuſall of our Sauiour. As if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould haue ſayd; <hi>His owne,</hi> to whome hee came, receiued him not: but if they had receiued him, they had thereby beene made the ſonnes of God.</p>
            <p>For that prerogatiue hee gaue to as many, as by faith entertained him. So that our Euangeliſt in this one verſe both implyes the vnrecouerable loſſe of the Iewes, and all other, that refuſe him; and expreſſeth the inualuable gaine of all, that receiued him, whether they were Iewes, or Gentiles. It ſeemes a ſmall matter (perhappes) to many a man, not to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt: yea ſome men thinke it little better, then ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, and baſeneſſe, to reſt vpon him. If theſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches knewe, what is loſt by refuſing him, what is gotten by receiuing him, they would run after him with all the haſte, they can poſſibly make, and imbrace him with both their armes.</p>
            <p>But I will leaue theſe points to bee amplyfied anone, when I haue handled the doctrine, that our Euangeliſt teacheth vs in this place: which is briefly this; that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer beleeues in Ieſus Chriſt, hath by that beleeuing, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to bee the ſonne of God.</hi> And becauſe the matter is of ſo great importance, containing the glorie of a true Chriſtian, and the meanes of attaining to it, let vs I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, ſtirre vp our ſelues, with all diligence, to know and doe that, which will, certainely, bring vs to the height of all true felicitie. To which purpoſe, I wil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide my whole diſcourſe into theſe two parts: <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue to be the ſonnes of God; The meanes of obtaining it.</hi> In the former, I will firſt ſhewe, what it is: that is heere vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chſaf't vs; <hi>To he the ſonnes of God.</hi> Secondly, that
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:21009:201"/> it is a prerogatiue; which is amplyfied by the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it: that it belonges to all, that beleeue. The later part offers two things to be conſidered, touching the meanes; That, <hi>this prerogatiue is giuen;</hi> that, <hi>on our part beleeuing in Chriſt is required.</hi> Many other points will fall in here, and there: but I content my ſelfe with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding theſe, that are moſt generall, and eaſie to bee diſcerned in the Text. The firſt point, concerning our being the ſonnes of God, requires that I ſhould ſhewe ſome reaſon, why the Euangeliſt makes choyſe of this benefit aboue the reſt: that being declared, I will come to the expoſition of the point it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Many, and excellent are the bleſſings, which it hath pleaſed God, of his infinite mercy, to beſtow vpon vs, in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>He ſaues vs from our ſinnes. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles vs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 21. Rom. 5. 10: 1. Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>to God; He is made vnto vs wiſedome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and redemption.</hi> When ſhould I make an ende, if I ſhould recite euerie particular? The queſtion is, why Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> paſſing ouer all other benefittes receiued by him, mentions this, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other. What if we ſay, he made eſpecial choiſe of this, becauſe it is the greateſt? Surely wee ſhall ſay no more, then is true, and not vn likely. For how could the Iewes be more iuſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the hearts of all men more inflamed with the loue of faith, or the kindneſſe of our Lord more amplyfied, then by propounding the chiefeſt of all the bleſſinges, whereof wee are made partakers by him? And what one is comparable to this? The ſauing vs from our ſinnes, to ſpeake properly, rather frees vs from miſerie, then brings vs to happineſſe. Sanctification doth no more, but refreſh the image of God in vs, which was decayed, or reſtore it being loſt; which can make vs but good ſeruants, at the beſt. If any man thinke, that to bee an heire, is a degree aboue being a ſonne; he muſt vnderſtand, that this implyes, that Chriſt makes none ſonnes, but hee makes them heyres too, by the ſame <note place="margin">Kom 8. 17.</note>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:21009:201"/> title. And therefore queſtionleſſe, there is no bleſſing obtained by him, that may ſtand in compariſon with this, <hi>To bee the ſonnes of God.</hi> I deny not then, but that this might bee reſpected of our euangeliſt in his choiſe of this benefit; but I thinke there were alſo other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it.</p>
            <p>Hee ſpake immedately before, of the Iewes not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Meſſiah. Now the Iewes were the men, that held themſelues onely to be the ſonnes of God, by reaſon of <hi>Abraham;</hi> from whom they were deſcended. Therefore the Lord challengeth them by the Prophet, <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> that they did not honour him. <hi>A ſonne honoureth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If I bee a father, where is mine honour?</hi> Contrarie to this conceite of theirs, the holy Ghoſt giues them to vnderſtand, that the honour to bee the ſonnes of God, is not appropriated to the Iewiſh nation, as they falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined, but is common to all the Gentiles, that will beleeue. As for them, their refuſall to beleeue in him, made them wholly deſtitute of that prerogatiue. What other bleſſing afforded vs by Chriſt, would ſo fittely haue met with that proud conceite of the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Iewes? Forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, they little, or not at all regarded; being puft vp with an ouer weening of their owne righteouſneſſe. They lookt for rewarde, not <note place="margin">Cyril. in Ioan lib. 1. cap. 13.</note> for pardon. Fitly therefore, to abate this pride, doth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> put them in minde of other ſonnes of God, <note place="margin">Ambroſ. de fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. lib. 4. cap. 4 Auguſt. in tract in Ioa 2. Bed. ad hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c. loc.</note> ſuch as they knew themſelues not to bee, for all their bragging. Another reaſon is added, and may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; that this was therefore eſpecially named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that, which being proper to Chriſt, hee, and hee onely could giue; that it may appeare, hee hath wholly communicated himſelfe vnto vs, if hee haue imparted that, which was ſo truely, and neerely his owne. Ought wee not then to bee ſo much the more carefull, both to knowe, and obtayne ſo incomparable a fauour? Can we content ourſelues, to be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it?
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:21009:202"/> Can wee indure one hower, to be without it? Had we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee ſeruants then ſonnes?</p>
            <p>Firſt, let vs vnderſtand what it is to bee a ſonne of God. A matter eaſily knowne, will ſome man ſay. For what is it elſe, but to haue our beginning, and as it were birth from GOD? So is <hi>Adam</hi> ſayde to bee the <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 10. Mal. 2. 10.</note> ſonne of God. So ſpeaketh <hi>Malachy</hi> of the Iewes <hi>Haue wee not all one Father? hath not one God made vs?</hi> If this bee all; <hi>To be a ſonne,</hi> is no more, then <hi>to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> or at the moſt, ſuch a creature, as is made after the image and likeneſſe of God. But this wee haue by nature in our creation, not by grace in regeneration. This they haue, that are borne after the ordinary courſe of men, <hi>of bloud, of the will of the fleſh, of the will of man.</hi> So are not they borne, of whome our Euangeliſt heere intreateth. <hi>Not of bloud</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>but of God.</hi> That manner of birth is common to all men, in all times, and places; this is a priuiledge voutchſaft to ſome onely. The former was already beſtowed vpon the Iewes, in that they were men.</p>
            <p>The later was to be receiued by the gift of Chriſt, by their becomming faithfull, or beleeuing men. To conclude, if the holy Ghoſt had meant ſuch kinde of ſonnes, he would neuer haue required faith in the name of Chriſt. What is it then, <hi>To be the ſonne of God?</hi> The Euangeliſt aunſweres in the next verſe, <hi>To bee borne of God.</hi> And are they, to whome our Lord giues this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being ſonnes, <hi>Borne of God?</hi> It ſhould ſeeme then they are the naturall ſonnes of God. For what is it, to be the naturall ſonne of any man, but to bee borne of him? but this is meerely impoſſible. Becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt is the onely begotten, or borne ſonne of GOD, and is thereby equall to his father, both in time, and dignitie; whereas theſe ſonnes, haue their beginning in time, and are no way comparable to God, in any degree. Therefore wee may not, at any hand,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:21009:202"/> when wee read, or heare of this birth (whereof more hereafter in the next verſe, and eſpecially in the thirde Chapter) once imagine, that we are properly ſayd to be borne of God; but that the ſpeech is tropical; that is to ſay, turned from the naturall ſignification, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another, by way of ſimilitude, or likeneſſe. I wil <note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>taphora.</note> ſpeake no more of the point at this time, then is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for our vnderſtandinge of the matter. For the helpe whereof, let vs conſider, how God is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and wee his ſonnes, in reſpect of our naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by creation.</p>
            <p>Euery man knowes, that he is not properly our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no nor was <hi>Adams.</hi> For then muſt he needs haue beene God by nature; and God hauing begotten him, as his naturall ſonne, muſt of neceſſitie haue beene ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and we all now are. How then is God <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams father.</hi> I confeſſe he is ſo, though I doe thinke, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> is not ſo to bee vnderſtood in the place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 38.</note> alleaged; where thoſe words <hi>the ſonne of God</hi> ſeem rather to belong to Ieſus, then to <hi>Adam.</hi> Well: yet is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> the ſonne of God: and not the natural ſonne. What ſonne then? If I ſhall aunſwere directly to the queſtion, I ſay hee is the <hi>Tropicall,</hi> and in particular the <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall</hi> ſonne of God. To ſpeake to the capacitie of the meaneſt, and ſimpleſt, who haue as much intereſt to this knowledge reuealed by God, for our inſtruction, as the nobleſt and wiſeſt; <hi>Adam</hi> is the ſonne of God by a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſpeech. For as men are naturally the fathers of them, who haue their being (in particular) from them: ſo is <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo are all men the ſons of God; becauſe they haue their firſt originall from him. <hi>Adam</hi> alſo may bee ſayde; ſomewhat more particularly, to bee the ſonne of God; becauſe hee was faſhioned, and formed by him, of the duſt of the ground, without any other meanes, then the will and word of God himſelf. And in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect may an Image, cut, caſt, or painted by any man,

               </gap>e called the ſonne of him, that was the maker of it. So may the bookes, that men write, be tearmed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as all men, in this ſenſe, are the Sonnes of God, touching their naturall being: So are ſome, euen as many as beleeue in Chriſt, his ſonnes, concerning their ſpirituall beeing. For it is God, that creates as it were, new hearts in them, that reſtores that image of his, which they had loſt, that giues them ſpirituall life, and motion to all righteous and holy actions. I do but name the things according to the preſent occaſion, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the handling of them, to more fit opportunitie in the next verſe. It is enough, that we vnderſtand, in what meaning wee are the Children of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But is this that, which the holy Ghoſt intendeth in this place, to ſignifie, that Chriſt is autor of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all them, that beleeue? I ſuppoſe this is not all. For it is eaſie for euery man to diſcerne, that the Text ſpeaketh of ſuch a being ſonnes, as followeth faith, and beleeuing: whereas the birth, that is mentioned in the verſe following, goeth before faith; which is one of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>e wee can beleeue: and our very being, is our being ſonnes. So the Iewes, vpon that promiſe of God to their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> were borne, not made ſonnes; their Adoption conſiſted not in the ſeuerall choyſe of particular men, but in ſeparating the ſeede of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> from all families, and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world whatſoeuer. Neither is our ſpirituall <hi>ſonneſhip</hi> of the former kinde attained to by faith; but by it we are made faithfull. Therefore to be ſonnes, is to be adopted by God for his children in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I will make bolde (with your good liking, I doubt not) to declare the point more fully, and plainely, by the opening of theſe two things; what adoption is; how God hath adopted vs. <hi>Adoption,</hi> if wee conſider the <note place="margin">Adoption.</note> word, for the nature of it, is nothing elſe, but chooſing to a mans ſelfe, whatſoeuer it bee, that is choſen. From this generall ſignification, the word is applyed, to note that particular choyſe of ſonnes or children. The Greek <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> expreſſeth the particular, and ſignifieth an appointing of children. The word being vnderſtood, it is no hard matter to knowe the nature of the thing it ſelfe; which (not to ſtand vpon any curious definition) <hi>is a chooſing, or taking of them for our Children, which by nature, are not ours.</hi> So (as wee heard) <hi>Iacob</hi> made choiſe of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſons, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes. Pharaohs</hi> daughter tooke the childe of an Hebrew, whome ſhee knew not. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicai</hi> choſe <hi>Esther,</hi> his Vncles daughter, to bee his childe. Let vs apply this to our owne Adoption. The father, that adopteth is God: the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are men and women. If they muſt become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by <hi>Adoption,</hi> it is cleer, they are none of his
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:21009:205"/> by nature. Whoſe then? I am a ſhamed and affraide to vtter it. Our Lord himſelfe hath told vs diſcouering the naturall eſtate of all men, in deſcribing the Iewes. <hi>Wee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 41.</note> 
               <hi>are not borne of fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> (ſay they to our ſauiour) <hi>We haue one father which is God.</hi> But what doth he anſwere them? <note place="margin">Ver. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are of your father, the Deuill.</hi> If the Iewes, Gods owne children, after an eſpeciall manner, yea <hi>his firſt borne,</hi> were notwithſtanding the children of the Diuell; ſurely no man in his naturall eſtate, can be the childe of God. <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 4.</note> 
               <hi>They had the Adoption, they had the Couenant.</hi> Other people had nothing affoorded them by God, but thoſe generall helpes, which are common to all by nature. What becomes of theſe children of the Diuell? As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, as beleeue in Chriſt, are by <hi>Adoption,</hi> made the ſons of God. Being ſons, they haue withal conuaied vnto them, not onely an intereſt, and claime to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſtate, be it neuer ſo great, but alſo the inheritance of heauen. <hi>If we be children, we are alſo heyres.</hi> This paſſeth the ordinarie courſe of <hi>Adoption.</hi> A man may adopt many ſonnes, and yet not make them all heyres. I doe but name theſe things now. They ſhall be amplified, if it pleaſe God, in the next point, where the Prerogatiue muſt be declared. In the meane while, let vs go forward to ſhew, How we are adopted.</p>
            <p>There are two things, that offer themſelues to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in reſpect of the party that adopteth; The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall motiues, why he will adopt: The particular reaſon, why he will make choiſe of this, or that perſon. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall motiues are ordinarily two: either ſimply default of naturall iſſue; or, at the leaſt, want of ſuch children as are fit for ſuch an eſtate, or inheritance. I confeſſe it was otherwiſe with <hi>Iacob,</hi> who had ſonnes enouw of his own body. The caſe was extraordinarie, &amp; hee directed by the ſpirit of prophecie, to make choiſe of them to that dignity. But (ordinarily) the motiues are ſuch, as I named; and, in likelihood, were the ſame, or one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:21009:205"/> in Pharaohs daughter, &amp; <hi>Mordecat.</hi> What place had they, in our adoption by God? Certainly none at all: Touching the former, which is the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon of the two; was God without iſſue? If he had bin; ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is eternall, as with out beginning, ſo without end, he needed not feare the decay of his houſe, for want of Poſteritie to ſucceede him. <hi>Dauid</hi> was to be gathered to <note place="margin">Pſal. 132. 11.</note> his fathers: &amp; therefore it was a ſingular fauour to him, that he ſhould haue children, to ſit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his throne after him. But he, that neuer dyeth; neuer groweth weake, or weary, hath no neede of a ſucceſſor, or aſſiſtant in his kingdome. But he had iſſue; euen a ſonne, the brightneſs of the glory, &amp; the ingrauen forme of the fathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Milk is not ſo like to milke, as that ſon is to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being in nature all one with him; differing in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that the one is the father &amp; not the ſonne, the other the ſonne, &amp; not the Father. But perhaps he might be vnfit for the managing of ſuch an eſtate, &amp; ſucceſſion to ſuch a father. Go to: let vs, for the better ſetting out of theſe points imagin a ſucceſſion, &amp; conceiue of God, for a while, as of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The vnfitnes in a ſon for ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is either from the weaknes of his body, that he is not likely to leaue iſſue behind him, or for the badneſs of his cariage, want of capacitie, diſſoluteneſs in gouernment, or ſome ſuch matter. This ſon of God (that I may not dwell too lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vpon this point, nor ſpeak any thing with out due reuernce of his maieſty) was euery way ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, &amp; fitted to his fathers minde, that it was imposſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will not ſay that any adopted ſonne ſhould come neere him, but that greater fitnes could be deſired, or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined. <hi>This is my beloued ſonne</hi> (ſaith the father of him) <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17. Chap. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> And he repeats that teſtimony, the ſecond time, at his transfiguration. It was not for neede then, as it is with men, that the Lord vouchfaf't to thinke vpon adopting of ſonnes.</p>
            <p>But admit the caſe had ſo ſtood with him, that it had bin requiſite for him, to make him ſonnes, by <hi>Adoption.</hi>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:21009:206"/> What is vſually the reaſon of mens particular choyſe? Is it not an affection, or liking, that the partie hath to ſome one, rather then to another? There may (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) be ſome other reſpects; but this is the commoneſt and beſt, ſetting that of kinred aſide. Conſider a little the dealing of our God, in this behalfe. Muſt he chooſe ſom creatures to be his ſonnes, and ioynt heires with his owne naturall ſon? He hath thowſands, and ten thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <note place="margin">Dan 7. 10.</note> thowſands of Angelles round about his throne, Glorious in their nature; Obedient in their ſeruice; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their deſires. Neuer a one of theſe is choſen to this fauour of <hi>Adoption.</hi> It may be, the Lord intendes to ſhew the riches of his mercy, by extending compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are in miſerie. Behold the Angels, that ly <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 4. lud. ver. 6.</note> in darkenes, reſerued to the iudgement of the laſt day. Is there any mans eſtate more deſperate? Haue any creatures greater need of ſuccor? Can there be more pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhewed to any? They are left in that damnable eſtate. The Lord turnes his face away from their miſery, and caſts his eyes of compaſſion on our wretchedneſſe. So makes he difference betwixt men, and Angels. Hee will adopt men, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Angels; becauſe his loue is greater to men, then to Angels.

They by amplification may bee made greater, then they are: theſe, the more you ſpeake of them, the leſſe you make them. For what is it, but a diminiſhing of that, which is infinite, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt in any kind of manner, I ſay not to inlarge, but euen
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:21009:206"/> to expreſſe it?

As for me, I profeſſe the contrary; aſſuring my ſelfe, and you, that when I haue ſaid all that poſſibly I can deuiſe, I ſhall be as farre from the infinitneſſe of the benefit, as when I firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeake of it. Yet may it ſomewhat helpe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt of the matter; though it cannot come neere the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the thing. And with this perſwaſion, let vs a little conſider <hi>the prerogatiue of this Son-ſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a great opinion, and not without good cauſe, of the eſtate of our firſt pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nts, <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> while they were in Paradiſe, before their fall. They had the image of God, wherein they were created, ſhineing <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> in them, ſo gloriouſly, that all the fiſhes in the ſea, the foules in the aire, the beaſts in the earth, and euery thing, that moueth, and creepeth on the earth, were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and obedient to them. What adoe haue wee, in our eſtate, as now it ſtandeth, to make, not Beares, or Lions, but thoſe of whome we haue neceſſary, and continuall vſe, horſes, and other cattle, to performe any kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to vs? The whip, the goad, the wand, the ſpur, the yoke the bit, all the meanes of terror, and extreamity, that wee can poſſibly deuiſe, cannot preuaile ſo much againſt theſe tame creatures, as autority, and maieſtie, did in them, with thoſe beaſts, that are now moſt fierce, and cruell. The Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> though he were a King of great command, ouer Gods owne free people; yet when he conſidered thoſe little poore ſeruices, which the creatures, in our preſent eſtate, ſuch as it is, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe vs, and the gouernement, wee haue ouer them, breaks out into an exclamation of wonder: <hi>What is man</hi> (ſaith he to the Lord) <hi>that thou art mindfull of him, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 8. 4.</note>

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:21009:207"/> haue eſteemed <hi>Adams</hi> rule ouer the creatures, that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues our gouernement of them ſo highly? What ſhould I ſpeake of their familiarity with God, who vouchſaf't himſelfe to talke with them, to informe, and direct them? It is recorded, as a ſingular fauour, and honour, done to <hi>Moſes, that the Lord ſpake vnto him face to face, as a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod 33. 11.</note>

            <p>But, to come to the point, for which al this is alledg'd; what was their eſtate, for all theſe honors, &amp; fauors, but the condition of ſeruants? They were threatned with death, death both of body, and ſoule, if they tranſgreſt the bounds, that were ſet them. <hi>Of the tree of knowledge of good, and euill, thou ſhalt not eate of it: for in the day thou</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in obedience to God their Creator, according to their allegeance, &amp; duty: What could they haue lookt for, but either a confirmation of that eſtate, which they then inioyed? or at the moſt, the reward of their ſeruice, the wages for their worke? They could neuer haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this dignity, <hi>To be the Sons of God.</hi> And is it not <hi>a prerogatiue</hi> (trowe you) to be brought by Chriſt into a more excellent eſtate, then that, which <hi>Adam,</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and glory, had iuſt cauſe to wonder at? Bleſſed may we ſay, was the day, and houre (Oh the goodneſſe &amp; power of God, that brings light out of darknes?) that euer <hi>Adam</hi> harkened to the voice of his wife perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to eate of the forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fruit. Not, that either the ſin was ſmall, to tranſgreſs the commandement of God; or that it was the purpoſe of <hi>Adam</hi> in ſinning, to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſo great a bleſſing: But for that the Lord, of his meere affection, &amp; loue, according to his owne former counſaile, &amp; predeſtination, turned miſery to happines, death to life. We were ſeruants to a bountiful, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Lord: we are made Sons to a moſt kind, &amp; louing

            <p>There is no ſeruant, though hee bee put in neuer ſo great truſt, haue neuer ſo much autority, bee neuer ſo highly in the Princes fauour, like <hi>Daniell</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 48.</note> of Babell, or <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in the Kingdome of Aegypt; but is many degrees, inferiour, to the Kings Sonne. <note place="margin">Gen. 41. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was a moſt faithfull ſeruant in the houſe of the Lorde, and diſpoſed of all things, after the direction, and to the eſpeciall liking of his maſter.

               <hi>Dauid</hi> when he was vrg'd, and preſt by the continual perſwaſion of many Courtiers, to put himſelfe forward and become the kings Sonne in lawe, excuſeth himſelfe by his pouerty, &amp; the meanneſs of his reputation. <hi>Seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to you a light thing to be a kings Sonne in lawe, ſeeing I</hi>

There is no diſparagement in the match to the wife, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of honour to the husband. But if a man of meane eſtate, and birth, be admitted to ſuch aduancement by marriage, how is he preferred, how is hee honoured? It ſhall be fit therefore, and needfull, to the ende wee may the better conceiue the excellency of our prerogatiue, in being made the Sonnes of God, to conſider, as the high eſtate, to which we ariſe, ſo the lowe degree, from which we were raiſed. Was it not, in euery mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, greater preferment, for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to be made ruler of all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> then for <hi>Putiphar,</hi> to haue beene aduaunced to the ſame honour and autority? <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was taken from priſon, at the loweſt ſtep, or rather not neere the ſtayer-foot:

               <hi>Putiphar</hi> was already aboue the midſt of the grees and could almoſt reach the top, from whence he ſtood.

               <hi>Dauid.</hi> For as the dignity of the maſter, is a credit to the ſeruant, and the ones dishonour, the others diſgrace: ſo, &amp; much more (as the bond betwixt them is neerer) the glory, or ſhame of the Father, is the reputation, or diſcredit, of the Sonne. Who is ſo vile, ſo wicked, ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as the Deuill? His former happineſſe makes his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſery the greater: as heate opens the pores of the body, and prepares a way for the more cold to enter.

It were much that thou ſhouldſt (at all) receiue mee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeruice. Yet if it pleaſe thee to vouchſafe mee that fauour; the meaneſt, or loweſt place, or office, in thy Palace, were to good for mee. To bee a door-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in thy houſe? It were a ſeruice ſit for thy holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, not for mee a prophane man. If thou wouldſt needes, of thy wonderfull bounty, preferre me high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thou might'ſt make mee free, at the moſt, and ſo ridde thy hands of me. Will not all this ſerue; but muſt I haue the prerogatiue to bee thy Sonne too? Me thinks, I ſhould but dreame of theſe fauours, and not poſſeſſe them indeed; they are ſo farre beyond, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expectation, but credit too. <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Angell came to deliuer him out of priſon, the night before hee <note place="margin">Act. 12. 9. 10.</note> ſhould haue beene executed, though hee aroſe, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his guide, paſſing the firſt, and ſecond watch, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the iron gate, which opened by it owne accord: yet ſtill thought, that hee had but ſeene a viſion, and could not perſwade himſelfe that he was indeed ſet at liberty. How much more vnlikely is it, that poore, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, damned Sonnes of the Diuell, ſhould find ſuch fauour, as to be made the Sonnes of God?</p>

               <hi>which the Angels deſired to behold.</hi> As if they coulde <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 12.</note> not ſatisfy themſelues, with thinking on it. This was the <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> prerogatiue, which ſome of the Angels could not abide ſhould be vouchſaf't to men, but murmured againſt <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 4.</note> God for it, &amp; rebelled to aduance themſelues; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they loſt both their place, and their honour. It is not ſo eaſy a matter (my brethren) to beleeue this point, as it is commonly thought to bee. And whereas it is ſo generally receiued for truth, of all that profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be Chriſtians: I am wholly of opinion, that it is rather a light perſwaſion, then a grounded beleefe. Dooſt thou beleeue, that as many, as truſt in Chriſt, are thereby the Sonnes of God? Let mee reaſon with thee a little, and take that I ſhall ſay, in good parte. For I doe it not to weaken thy perſwaſion, but to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy faith. Haſt thou euer confidered this point ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and debated it aduiſedly, with thine owne heart? Doſt thou truly diſcerne, and acknowledge that thou art naturally the child of the Diuell? What? Dooſt thou ſtart at this? Doe I ſeeme to wrong thee, in abaſing thy eſtate ſo much? Thou art content to ſay, thou art a ſinner; and it may bee, thou dooſt indeed thinke thy ſelfe to haue deſerued the wrath of God: but thou canſt not abide, to haue it thought, that thou wert at any time the Sonne of the Diuell. This opinion would diſgrace thee too much, and affright thee too ſore. It were a harde matter, for thee indeed euer to beleeue, that God woulde make thee his Sonne, if thou hadſt this perſwaſion of thy ſelfe, that thou art the childe of the Diuell. I I am naught (ſaiſt thou) as other men are, and I haue neede of Gods mercy, and I hope hee will bee as good to mee, as to any other. But neuer thinke to make me beleeue, that I am ſo bad.

How many weekes, or daies, or houres, haue you ſpent, in the ſearch of this <hi>Adoption,</hi> which is vouchſaf't you in Chriſt? Haue you learnd, what it is to bee a Sonne? Haue you made any eſtimate of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, that is promiſed? Doe you knowe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a ſeruant, and a Sonne? Is not al your truſt in the plea of ſeruants? If I doe my good will (ſaith one) I knowe God will accept of it. What though I be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the myſtery of my redemption? Alas! I am no Diuine, no Scholler, not booke learned; God lookes for no ſuch greate knowledge of mee. I can tell, that I muſt loue God aboue all things, and my neighbour as my felfe. If I doe this, I am ſure God will bee mercifull to mee; and I ſhall goe to heauen, O the blindneſſe, the wilfull blindneſſe of ignorant men? How long will yee deſpiſe the kind offer of the Lord? When will yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to conſider, what honour he hath vouchſaf't you? When will you haue any care, to vnderſtand your own happineſſe? The Lord God would haue you his Sonnes: you wil continue obſtinatly in the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſeruants. Hee would beſtow heauen vpon you, as an inheritance: you will needes haue it as wages. Hee offers to giue you title to it, by adoption; you ſtriue to lay clayme to it, by your owne purchaſe. Would you chooſe to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants rather then Sonnes, if you had any knowledge of theſe 2. eſtates? You haue heard ſomewhat of the ioyes of heauen, and you haue (accordingly) a plaine confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

From hence, ariſeth a kinde of deſire to bee partakers of thoſe pleaſures, and by the flattery of ſelfe loue, ſome manner of perſwaſion, that ye ſhall enioy them.

If it continue with thee, as long as thou continueſt aliue; yet leaues thee, when thou dieſt; whereas that heauenly preferment abides with thee, &amp; attends vpon thee after death, or rather lifts thee vp, and carries thee aliue to heauen. For, what though this ſinfull earthly carcaſſe be deſtroyed? yet the ſoule mounts, immediatly, vp to heauen, taking poſſeſſion of that inheritance, and inioying it with al freedome, &amp; comfort, in aſſured expectation of proportionable glory wherewith the body, in due time, ſhall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and beautifyed.</p>

            <p>Nay; will ſome man reply, you miſtake the matter. The Euangeliſt ſpeakes not of any ſuch prerogatiue, as you imagin, by which men are actually, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made the Sonnes of God; but of the power that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to them, whereby they haue free will to receiue, or acknowledge Chriſt, and ſo at laſt, to be made the Sons of God. There is no remedy, though I haſtned all I could, to the diſpatch of that, which remaines, but I muſt needs make a little ſtay; that I may the better cleere the way before me. And becauſe our Rhemiſts are the men, that prepare theſe forts againſt vs, I will incounter them hand to hand, as they haue ranged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in order, vpon their beſt aduiſement. There haue beene many ſkirmiſhes, and ſomebattailes, about this hold of freewill, which is the very ſtrength of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of popery; vpon which, all their ſatis faction, and merits abſolutly depend; ſo that, if this were once ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, the beſt parte of Romiſh reuenues, by which their warres are mayntained, were vtterly cut off, and their power exceedingly weakned.

But firſt I will giue you a view of it, as it ſtandes in all the brauery. Becauſe the place, of it owne nature, affords no firme grounde, for ſuch a building, they lay a forced and falſe foundation. For whereas, the holy Ghoſt ſpeakes of <hi>dignity,</hi> and <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> noting the honour we receceiue, not the ſtrength; they turne vp that ground, and tell vs of I knowe not what <hi>power.</hi> This fraud of theirs I doe but name, becauſe I diſcouered it to the full in my laſt exerciſe, and digd it vp, with the labour, and tooles of their owne workmen.

There is no mention heere but only of power, concerning the later; ſo that the former ſtands neither ſafely, nor handſomely, tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering all aſide, and ready to fall, with the leaſt breath, that ſhall blowe vpon it.

Laſtly for the increaſe of this deformity; the roofe hath no faſhion in it, nor proportion to the reſt of the building.

Nothing leſſe. Who ſees not that it is abſurd to ſay, that power was

Nay rather hee had need of power, that he may not be forced. I take no pleaſure in this courſe of reprouing their imperfections: but their owne inſolency in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning al men, in compariſon of their owne faction, &amp; the miſerable doating of their followers vpon them, as if there were no learning, but in their heads, makes mee think it not only lawfull, but alſo needfull, to lay open ſuch palpable defects. Now to the ſtrength of this Fort.</p>
            <p>Where <hi>Freewill</hi> vaunts it ſelfe, as if it were ſet vpon a moſt ſure ground. The foundation, as they would haue it, <hi>is, power to be made, the Sonnes of God.</hi> Firſt, I haue ſhewed already, that the word which our Euangeliſt here vſeth, though ſometimes it ſignify <hi>power,</hi> yet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taken, in the Scripture, for freedome of wil. But ſay it were, now, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo taken, &amp; that in this place it belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to the ſame matter: yet were it not wel applyed by theſe Papiſts. For the holy Ghoſt, dooth not ſpeake heere of power to receiue Chriſt, but to bee made the Sonnes of God. Hee had no meaning to ſhewe, what was giuen men to enable them, for the receiuing of Chriſt; but to declare, what they ſhould attaine to, by receiuing him: ſo that this firſt part of their annotation, hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Text. If any man think, that they may be excuſed, as grounding this note of freewill vpon thoſe other words, <hi>As many as receiued him;</hi> I will ſhew anone, if God will, againſt ſome other popiſh writers, that no ſuch thing will follow therevpon: in the meane while it is eaſy to ſee, that this defence, cannot helpe the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, who raiſe their building, vpon the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Hee gaue them power.</hi>

               <hi>Power giuen to men</hi> (ſay they) <hi>if they will, to be made by Chriſt the Sons of God.</hi> Now power, but <hi>honour,</hi> or <hi>preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</hi> But let that paſſe, as already handled: And ſo let vs
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:21009:217"/> paſſe ouer the other words, <hi>To bee made,</hi> though the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt ſay <hi>to be.</hi> I may not forget to note, that they ſpeake craftily, and inſufficiently, for the expreſſing of the Text, <hi>Power giuen to men.</hi> Why doe they not rather follow the Euangeliſt? And if they will needes haue it to bee, <hi>Power;</hi> ſay as hee doth, giuen to <hi>as many as receiue Chriſt. Giuen to men;</hi> ſay they. To what men? To them that beleeue in the name of Chriſt. Hee ſpeakes not of compariſon, betwixt men, and Angels, but of difference betwixt men, and men. All haue not this prerogatiue, call it power if you will, <hi>To be made the Sonnes of God.</hi> It is proper to them only, that receiue him, by truſting in him. <hi>As many as receiued him, to them he gaue the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</hi> You will ſay, That honour, or power is denyed no man. It is graunted to no man, but to him that beleeues in Chriſt. But euery man may beleeue. Of that in the next point. What then? Therefore this power is giuen to men, <hi>To be made the Sonnes of God.</hi> The queſtion is not ſo much of the truth of this ſpeech, as of deliuering the Euangeliſts meaning: who intends not to ſhewe, what power is giuen to men in generall; but what benefit they (in particular) reape, which by faith receiue Chriſt that came into the world, and to his owne. Trowe yee it was his purpoſe to ſay, that the world, which knewe him not, and his owne, that receiued him not, had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er giuen them to be made the Sonnes of God? I dare ſay yee doe not thinke ſo. But perhaps freewill was giuen to men. This alſo appertaines to the next point; yet a word, for anſwere to the doubt. Either it was not giuen at all, or to them only, that had the Goſpell preacht vnto them. For we may not dreame of, I cannot tel what free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will, whereof all men ſhould be partakers, by the vertue, and efficacy of our Sauiours comming into the world. There is no ſuch matter. If free wil to receiue Chriſt be not common to all men by nature, it is giuen by certaine meanes, to certaine men, and not to other.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:21009:218"/> There is no poſſibility of being made the Son of God, but vpon a ſuppoſition of faith, by the doctrine of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>But if by <hi>Freewill to acknowledge Chriſt, and power to be made the Sonne of God,</hi> they vnderſtood no more, but the contrary to that, which they deny in the laſt place; namely, <hi>being forced, ordrawne therevnto, by neceſſity;</hi> wee would readily, and willingly ſubſcribe to their opinion. For we know it is needleſſe, that God ſhould force a man to that, to which he can, without any viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and incline him. Yea, we confeſſe it is held by vs for an impoſſibility, that the will ſhould be forced; that a man ſhould wil, &amp; not wil. But this is the maine matter that muſt be handled againſt other adverſaries by &amp; by; &amp; I haſten to it. Only giue me leaue to add this one thing, concerning the point of freewil, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on this place of Scripture by the Rhemiſts; that iſ I grant them their tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet freewil hath but a ſlippry foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therevpon. <hi>He gaue them power to be made the Sons of God;</hi> what of that? Therfore it was in their own choiſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would be the Sons of God, or no, &amp; they had power to be, if they would. It is out of queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they could not be, vnleſs they would, ſuppoſing that they were not, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their beleeuing. But this freedome of will cannot be drawne neceſſarily out of theſe words. Is it al one to ſay, <hi>He gaue them power to be made the Sons of God; &amp; He gaue them free wil to chooſe whether they wold be made the Sons of God, or no? Power giuen to ſuch a purpoſe inferrs a kind of faculty, reſting in him, to whom it is giuen, to doe that which it is giuen for.</hi> This if the holy Ghoſt had intended to ſignify, he would rather haue ſaid; <hi>He gaue them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to make themſelues the Sons of God, if they would:</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>By which they might be willing to be made the Sonnes of God,</hi> by beleeuing they were made capeable of that prerogatiue. As one that is born, &amp; brought vp in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, hath no poſſibility to beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e Mayor, or ſheriff of this Citty: But if hee hath his freedome beſtowed
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:21009:218"/> vpon him, and he hath there wit hall power giuen him to bee made a giuernour, though his power doe not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any freewill: So it is with them, that haue attayned to faith, (I ſpeake according to the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> conceite, and tranſlation) who haue power to bee made the ſonnes of God, and yet this power proues not any free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will.</p>
            <p>Thus, and thus weakely haue our <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> built their Forte, for the ſafety of their kingdome of free will. The foundation is ſandy, the building neither faire for ſight, nor ſtrong for vſe. Some other of the ſame crue, haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make good that point out of this place, by an other kinde of ſortification. <hi>It is apparant</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>that it is the power of free will, or that it is the office of free</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Michaell de Palacio, in Ioa. c. 1. enarrat. 28. Liberi eſſe arbit</note> 
               <hi>will, to receiue, or not receiue the worde of God; becauſe the Euangeliſt tells vs that ſome doe receiue, and ſome doe not.</hi> This man made better choiſe of his ground, then our <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> did. For hee layes his foundation on the very wordes of the holy Ghoſt rightly vnderſtood; <hi>His owne receiued him not. But as many as receiued him, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt wordes are plaine <hi>of his not being receiued:</hi> the later ſufficiently implyed that <hi>ſome did receiue him;</hi> els would the Euangeliſt haue ſaid; But if any man had receiued him, he would haue giuen him the Prerogatiue, to be the Sonne of God. A good beginning; but hee failes in the purſuit of the matter. And yet if his meaning were no other, then his words may well beare, hee might bee allowed in that, hee ſaith. For it is not to bee denied, that it is the will of man, that either receiueth, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt. This I ſpeake according to the true nature of ſaith, which is to reſt vpon Chriſt for ſaluation: and that reſting is an action of the will. But if I were to ſpeak, after the opinion of the Papiſts, (as he ſhould haue done) who place faith in the vnderſtanding, I ſee not how I might truely affirme that it it the office of the will, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, or not to receiue Chriſt. For it is not in the power
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:21009:219"/> of the will, to beleeue, or not to beleeue; that is to acknowledge a thing to bee true, or falſe, any more then it is for a man to take that to bee white, which hee ſees to be blacke, red, yellow, greene, or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colour, then white. In ſuch caſes, there is no manner of command in the will ouer the vnderſtanding. Well may it preuaile ſo farre, as to hinder the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in examining of a truth, or in the profeſſing of that it conceiues; yea it may carry a man with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to make contrarie profeſſion to that, he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of and knows: but it cannot poſſibly be of force to inioyne it, to holde this, or that for truth, otherwiſe then naturall, or ſupernaturall light diſcouers it to be.</p>
            <p>It is the will then, that receiues Chriſt, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, beleeues, or beleeues not: taking faith for truſting in Chriſt, as wee doe; not, as the Papiſts doe, for beleeuing the truth of that which is deliuered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, in the Scripture. Neither yet is it to bee helde for true, that there is any ſuch power, or office of free will, as the Papiſts dreame of, to bee concluded out of this place. For I may not runne into a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Doctrine: but muſt keepe my ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of this one Text. The free will, which the Papiſts fight for, as for their free hold, is <hi>an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute libertie in the will of Man, to chooſe, or refuſe, at his owne pleaſure.</hi> This they ſay wee haue, and vſe in the accepting, or reiecting of grace: which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs by God; but ſo, that it is left to vs, to receiue, or refuſe it. This Doctrine ſay I, can not bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by this ſcripture. Let any reaſonable man iudge. <hi>Some refuſe CHRIST, ſome receiue him;</hi> what will you inferre herevpon? That therefore <hi>it is left to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans choyſe, whether hee will receiue him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him?</hi> Tell me, what you thinke of the firſt grace, by which a man is inhabled to take, or leaue. I will ſpeake as plaine, as by any meanes I can, that euery
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:21009:219"/> man may vnderſtand mee. It is agreed vpon, on both ſides, theirs, and ours, that naturally no man hath any power to receiue <hi>CHRIST,</hi> or to will to receiue him. Therefore this <hi>Abilitie,</hi> of the vſing whereof wee diſpute, is vouchſaf't to euery one, that hath it, by God, and proceedes of him. Shall I reaſon now, as as our Papiſts doe? Some men haue this grace, by which they are able to beleeue, ſome men haue it not. Therefore there is free will in men to haue it, or want it. Will this follow vpon that? No more will it; that there is free will, becauſe ſome beleeue, and ſome doe not.</p>
            <p>Indeede, if there were nothing els to bee found, from which this difference might bee fetcht, but onely the will of man; there were ſome good reaſon to conclude freedome of will, from choiſe, and refuſall. But the caſe ſtanding, as it doth, that wee can aſſigne a better reaſon of this diuerſitie, euen the worke of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by grace in the hearts of as many as beleeue, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts concluſion is weake, and lame. <hi>Some receiue, ſome refuſe:</hi> Therefore (ſay they) <hi>there is free will, by the power whereof the one ſort beleeue, and the other, for not vſing that power, beleeue not.</hi> Nay rather (ſay wee) Therefore <hi>the grace of GOD workes more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in the hearts of ſome, then of other ſome.</hi> Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian ſoule, whom this concluſion of ours will not content better, then that of theirs? Surely he muſt needs loue his owne glorie, better then Gods, that had rather aſcribe his faith, to his owne free will, then to the grace of God. Haue I not yet ſpoken enough; or not plaine enough? Bee not wearied I beſeech you, though I dwell a little longer vpon the matter. I hope I ſhall better expreſſe my minde, and you better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me. That <hi>abilitie to beleeue</hi> comes of God, and not of our ſelues, it is out of queſtion betwixt vs. The doubt is, touching the vſe of this abilitie.</p>

            <p>For example; Let vs ſuppoſe, that both the theeues that were crucified with our Sauiour Chriſt, had this grace beſtowed on them by God, that they were able to beleeue. He on the right hand vſeth this grace, and beleeueth; the other doth not vſe it, and continueth in vnbeliefe. The queſtion is, whence this difference ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. <hi>From the power of free will;</hi> ſay the Papiſts. <hi>From the workes of Gods grace,</hi> ſay wee. Wee deny not (ſay they), that the grace of God workes more effectually in the one, then in the other: but wee affirme, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this difference in working, proceeds from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vſe of free will, in each of them. If hee, on the left hand, had bin willing to beleeue, the ſpirit of God would haue begotten faith in his heart. If he had on the right hand bin vnwilling, the grace of God would haue brought forth no faith in him. Yet they touch not the point. I preſſe them for a farder anſwere. Whence was it, that the one was willing, rather then the other? Speake out, that all men may heare you. Was it from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or from God? From both. They are halfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, to bee knowne what they hould, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtriue, to ſhift of the matter, in this ſort. But it will not ſerue the turne. I looke for a plaine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect anſwere. When both the theeues were alike vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and might both alike become willing, whence aroſe the beginning of difference betwixt them? You cannot ſay, it came from God; for in reſpect of him, they were yet both alike. What remaines then to be anſwered, but that the one, of himſelfe, did yeeld to the motion of Gods ſpirit, the other might haue done, but woulde not. I confeſſe, you ſay, there wanted aſſiſtance from God, to leade him forward to the obtaining of Faith: but yet you ſtill auouch, that the Originall of the difference was from the free will of man, that yeelded; not from the free grace of God, that inclined him to yeelding. For that grace was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:21009:220"/> to him with the other, in whome there was no wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs at all.</p>
            <p>What was become of the zeale of the glorie of God, when men firſt broch't theſe deuiſes? Is it not enough for vs, that wee are willing to bee ſaued, but that wee muſt alſo take the cheefe glorie of it to our ſelues? Are wee ſo puft vp with pride, and ſelfe loue, that wee had as lieue periſh, as bee beholden to <hi>GOD</hi> for our ſaluation? Blame mee not, if I charge the pride of mans Nature very deepely in this caſe. It is a matter, that concernes my Lord, and maiſter, (on whoſe meſſage I come) very neere. Hath hee, of himſelfe, vouchſafed meanes, by which wee may bee ſaued; hath hee, meerely of his owne good will, imparted the knowledge thereof vnto vs; hath hee, without any deſert, or deſire on our part, prouided, to aduance vs to the eſtate of Sonnes, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Seruants; and doe wee grudge to let him haue the honour of it? A little is too much for God; nothing is enough for our ſelues. Wee are content (with much adoe) to let it bee thought, and ſaid, that wee are not able without grace, to doe that, by which the fauour of <hi>GOD</hi> may bee procured. But when wee haue once receiued from God abilitie to beleeue (I ſpeake ſtill, as the Papiſts doe, againſt whom I reaſon) then it lies in our owne power to be ſaued, or to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. There is no queſtion of the later; but the cauſe of damnation is alwaies in our ſelues; and ſo in our ſelues, that, of our ſelues, there is no poſſibilitie, what grace ſoeuer wee haue receiued, to eſcape it. But the power to receiue Chriſt, that wee may bee made partakers of that Inheritance of Sonnes, is wholly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and not from our ſelues. What ſaid I? The power? It is not enough. The will to vſe that power? It is not enough. The will to vſe that power, is ſtirred vp, put forward, and inclined to it, onely, and altogether by God himſelfe. The act of the wil in reſting vpon Chriſt
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:21009:221"/> is mine. The inclining the will to doe this act, is Gods, and not mine. I doe willingly, and by mine owne choyſe beleeue in CHRIST. I am made willing, marke what I ſay, I am made willing: not onely I am made able to will; but directed, and perſwaded, and brought to will, yea inclined to this choiſe, by the power of the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>Doth any man doubt of this point? Hee knowes not or conſiders not, what it is to giue the glorie of his ſaluation to God. Shall I ſo part ſtakes with God, in this matter, that I take the biggeſt for mine owne ſhare? I will barely propound the caſe; let euerie Chriſtian ſoule iudge vprightly, betwixt God, and himſelfe. That there is any poſſibilitie of ſaluation for man, it is wholly, and onely from God, who (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the counſell, or perſwaſion of any creature) appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the meanes to ſaue vs by, of his meere mercie, and bounty. That I, among many other, attaine to that grace, by which I am inabled to beleeue, and may if I will, it is alſo from the ſame goodneſs, and fauour of the Lord; who doth not altogether leaue mee in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but moues, and perſwades mee by his ſpirit, to vſe the grace I haue receiued, and to beleeue in Chriſt. What woulde you haue more? ſaith one. Doe I not giue glory enough to God, by acknowledging, that poſſibilitie of faith, both in generall, and particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from his grace. Looke not that I ſhould anſwere thee. I appeale to thine owne conſcience, to giue ſentence of the matter. Thou aſcribeſt no more to God, but that he hath giuen thee grace, by which thou mayeſt beleeue, if thou wilt. Whence haſt thou this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to will? From Gods motion, and perſwaſion. Take heede what thou ſayeſt. How will this ſtand with that opinion of free will, which makes the firſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt thee &amp; other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that beleeue not, though they haue the like motions, and perſwaſions from God?
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:21009:221"/> It cannot be, if thou wilt ſpeak plaine, but thou muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that this willingneſs comes from thy ſelfe. So then thus ſtands the caſe; That we can beleeue, if wee liſt, it is of God: that we liſt to beleeue, it is of our ſelues. For ought that God did for mee, I might haue continued in vnbeliefe, and bin damned: that I might be ſaued, I may thanke him; that I am ſaued, my ſelfe. Is there any Chriſtian heart, that doth not riſe againſt this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? Can wee indure to thinke, that wee are more beholden to our owne will for faith, then to the grace of God; Can wee be ſo vnthankfull, ſo proud? But I will ſtay my ſelfe, leaſt I ſeeme to bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſo groſſe an error can finde place in a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſoule.</p>
            <p>Nay: ſaith one. Rather it is a moſt groſſe error to hold, as you doe, that a man is forced, and drawne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue by neceſſitie, whether hee will or no. Out of queſtion, it is indeed a groſſe error, to haue any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of a mans attaining to faith in Chriſt. And yet (giue me leaue to ſpeake my minde plainely, and freely) I had rather be abſurd in deſtroying the will of man, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in ouerthrowing the glory of God. But hee, that rightly vnderſtands, what wee teach of mans beleeuing, ſees there is no cauſe to feare either the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is cleere, &amp; certaine, that the maine chance is ſafe, the glorie of God being ſo carefully prouided for, and maintained: If wee erre, our error is leſſe dangerous. For there is not ſo much danger in depriuing man of his free will, as in robbing God of his glorie. But wee doe man no wrong at all; vnleſs it be a wrong, to giue more to GOD, then to man, in the begetting of faith. God perſwades, and inclines him to beleeue. What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or drawing is this? Yes: ſay they. For you teach, that by this inclining of the heart, GOD ſo workes vpon it, that the partie cannot chooſe, but beleeue. Not chooſe? For any force that is vſed, againſt
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:21009:222"/> the nature of his will, hee may chooſe. In reſpect of euent, hee can not. I will ſpeake plainer, if I can. God doth not force a man, as the Oxe is drawne to the ſlaughter, or a peece of Timber thruſt forward, by mayne ſtrength; but inclines the heart, ſweetely, and gently, according to the nature of it to him perfectly known; yet ſo powerfully, that it can not come to paſſe, but the partie ſhall both will to beleeue, and beleeue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede. Wee confeſſe there is a neceſſitie, in regard of the euent, that, vpon this inclination, faith ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſue; but wee denie all conſtraining, or forcing, by which the will ſhoulde loſe his vertue, or action. No man beleeues, but willingly. No man is willing, but hee that is inclined thereto by God. No man is forced to willingneſs by any conſtraint. I inquire not how the Lord inclines mee. I beleeue, that hee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline mee. I finde I am, of vnwilling, made willing. I ſee not any force vſed to make mee willing. Other men refuſe Chriſt willingly: I receiue him willingly. They are borne willingly to all, that is euill: I am made willing to whatſoeuer good, I doe will.</p>
            <p>It is not then power of free will, but Prerogatiue of Honour, that our Euangeliſt ſaith is giuen to them, that beleeue in Chriſt. Now for the farder amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this mercie, wee muſt conſider the generalitie of the gift. Which is ſuch, that it extends it ſelfe to all men, whatſoeuer. <hi>As many as receiued him, to them hee gaue, &amp;c.</hi> There is no diſtinction of Iewe, or Gentile, male or female, rich or poore, bond or free, one or other; but whoſoeuer beleeues in Chriſt, hath the Prerogatiue to bee the Sonne of God. This (in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) is that, which the Apoſtle deliuers. But, for our better inſtruction, it will not be amiſſe to handle the point, ſomewhat more largely; in theſe two parts: Firſt, to ſet out the vouchſafing of this priuiledge, to the Gentils, as well as to the Iewes: Secondly, to apply it to
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:21009:222"/> the ſeueral eſtates, conditions, &amp; differences, that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily found amongſt men. So ſhall the generalitie of the benefit appeare more cleerely: So ſhall euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mans comfort be the greater.</p>
            <p>There was a time, (as it is not vnknowne (I hope) to any man in this Auditorie) when the Iewes onely were the people of <hi>GOD; To whome (as</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>the Adoption, and the Glorie, and the Couenants,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom 9. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and the giuing of the Lawe, and the ſeruice of GOD and the promiſes appertained.</hi> They onely were the Children; all other Nations whatſoeuer, but dogges <note place="margin">Math. 15. 26.</note> The bread belonged to them, the moſt that other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could haue, was but the crums falling from then Table. What ſhould I proceede in amplifying of this point? I ſpake of it, at large, in a former exerciſe, <note place="margin">Serm. 7.</note> vpon the eleuenth verſe; when I ſhewed, that the Iewes were Chriſts owne, though they receiued him not. As for vs the Gentils, what were we? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 12.</note> tells vs, that <hi>we were Alians from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſraell, ſtrangers from the Couenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, hauing no hope, beeing without GOD in the world.</hi> It is worthily thought a ſingular fauour of God, that <hi>Iacob</hi> was preſerred before <hi>Eſau,</hi> the yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 23.</note> before the elder; yet were both ſonnes. What a kindneſs, grace, bounty, (no wordes are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the worth of the thing) is it, to make ſeruants Sonnes, to adopt them for children, that of themſelues, were no better then dogges? The Iewes thought it a ſtrange matter, and a great wrong to their Nation, that the Gentils ſhould bee taught the worde of God. <hi>Will hee goe to them, that are diſpearſed among the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 36.</note> (ſay they of our Sauiour) <hi>and teach the Grecians?</hi> And when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tolde them, that hee was appointed to preach the GOSPELL to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, they were not able to indure it, but ſared like madde men, <hi>crying out, caſting off their clothes, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 22. 23.</note>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:21009:223"/> 
               <hi>throwing duſt into the ayre.</hi> What ſpeake I of the Iewes, that might eaſily bee blinded with enuy and pride? We heard eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now, what account was to be made of the Gentils, by the teſtimonie of the truth it ſelfe. Therefore our Sauiour directly affirmeth, that <hi>He was not ſent, bat to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſraell.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 26.</note> when hee ſends forth his Diſciples to preach, hee forbids them <hi>to goe into the way of the Gentils, or</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10, 5.</note> 
               <hi>to enter into the Citties of the Samaritans.</hi> This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was ſo deepely ſettled in the hearts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <note place="margin">Act. 10. 28.</note> that <hi>Peter</hi> thought it vnlawfull for him to impart the Goſpell to the Gentils. Yea ſo generall was this conceite, that after Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, preached, to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> hee was accuſed for <note place="margin">Chap. 11. 23.</note> it, as guiltie of ſome hainous crime.</p>
            <p>Such was the eſtate of vs, that were Gentils by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; wee were ſo farre from beeing Sonnes, that we were not admitted to haue the loweſt office, or place in the houſe of God. Now, by the comming of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, this honour is vouchſaf't vs, that euery one of vs, that beleeues in him, doth thereby become the childe of God. They that before might not bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to waſh diſhes in the kitchin, may now ſeede on the Lords owne diſh, at his table. There is now no difference betwixt Iewe, and Grecian; but all are one in <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 28.</note> Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>It is one God, who ſhall iuſtifie circumciſion of faith, and circumciſion through faith.</hi> But ſome man <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 30.</note> perhaps will ſay, that this Prerogatiue was alwaies affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Gentils: for whom it was lawfull to ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Iewes; and to be made one with the people of God. It is true indeede, that the Gentils were neuer ſo excluded, but that, if they offered themſelues, to bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, they might be receiued, and numbred amongſt the Iewes. What new fauour then, is vouchſaf't them, by the comming of Chriſt? A full right, and intereſt to all the promiſes of euerlaſting life, which before (generally)
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:21009:223"/> did not concerne them. Now the Goſpell offers our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt no leſſe to the Gentils (If not more) then to the Iewes. <hi>Hee came to his owne,</hi> for to them he was <note place="margin">Act. 13. 46.</note> firſt, and principally ſent: <hi>his owne receiued him not;</hi> the Multitude, Rulers, and People refuſed to take him for their Meſſiah, and Sauiour. What then? Shall his comming be to no purpoſe? The Iewes indeede had a conceite, that none, but they, or at the moſt ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned themſelues to them, could bee the Sonnes of God. But they were much deceiued.

It were in vaine to ſpeake generally of the Gentils, in this place; The exhortation belongs to this Kingdome, this Citie, this Auditorie. Wee are all Gentils, hauing no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in thoſe ancient priuiledges of the Iewes: yet are wee vouchſafed by fauour to bee the Sonnes of <hi>GOD,</hi> if by faith we truſt in <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi> Can wee deſpiſe, or neglect, ſo rare a kindneſs, ſo great an honour? Doe wee preferre the profits, the pleaſures, the aduancements of this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inheritance of the Kingdome of Heauen? Let vs remember what wee were; men without God, without hope. See, what wee are; people, to whome
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:21009:224"/> Ieſus Chriſt, hath a long time offered, and doth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, euen now, at this hower, in this place, offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

O the wilfulneſs of them, that will not learne! None receiue Chriſt, but they, that beleeue in him. It is not enough to giue him the hearing, or to bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that hee is the ſauiour of the world: they only are ſonnes, that truely reſt vpon him, without hope, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any other helpe.</p>
            <p>All ſuch, whether they bee Iewes, or Gentils, haue the Prerogatiue, to bee the Sonnes of <hi>GOD.</hi> What? All? Yea all; without exception of any man, woman, or childe whatſoeuer. Wee heard as much erewhile, out of the Apoſtle; <hi>There is neither Iewe, nor</hi>

Looke but two verſes before, and you ſhall ſee, he ſpeakes of the matter, wee haue now in hand, of beeing the Sonnes of God: for <hi>yee are all</hi> (ſaith hee to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians)</hi>

We finde, euery day, by common experience in our ſelues, and others, that if a man haue a Sonne, that is blinde, lame, deafe, dumbe, or any other way deformed, hee will bee ready, and deſirous to take ſome courſe, if hee be his heyre, to ſettle his inheritance vpon ſome other of his Children. Surely I thinke, the man is hardly to bee found, that if hee had no heyre, would adopt ſuch a one for his Sonne, to ſucceede him in his Inheritance. How ſhould wee then valewe the ineſtimable fauour of God, that makes offer of an Adoption, and Inheritance, to the moſt contemptible wretches, that liue vpon the face of the earth? Heere is loue; heere is bounty. The fauours of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes are but fancies, not ſo much as ſhadowes, if you compare them with the kindneſs of God. I confeſſe, they had neede to looke to their owne eſtate. Their Dominions, and their treaſures are finite. The greateſt Monarchy, that euer was, diuided amongſt as many, as woulde accept of it, could afford but
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:21009:225"/> very ſmall ſhares to euery one. Oh that all men would receiue Ieſus Chriſt! There is roome enough, &amp; wealth enough in heauen, to giue full content to as many, as can deſire it.</p>
            <p>Come then I beſeech you, let vs ſettle forward to meete Ieſus Chriſt, that wee may receiue him. Let <note place="margin">—Non magna relinquam,—Magna ſequar-Ouid. metamorph. lib. 7.</note> not Farmes, Oxen, or wiues holde vs backe: They are no great matters, wee ſhall leaue: They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly great wee ſhall attaine to. Is it not better to exchange them now, while wee may doe it with ſuch profit, then to forgoe them, no man knowes how ſoone when wee can make nothing of them? What is it wee miſlike? To be Sonnes? No man is ſo baſe, or ſo fooliſh, as to thinke bondage, better then free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. To bee the Sonnes of God? It were againſt reaſon, and nature, not onely againſt Religion, to refuſe ſuch an honour. What ſhould I ſay? Eyther wee beleeue not, that there is any ſuch Prerogatiue to bee had, or wee thinke, it is not worth the paines, we muſt take to get it. Wee dare not bee knowne of the former, for the very ſhame of the world, ſeeing we profeſſe Chriſtian Religion. If wee pleade the later, our owne heart will condemne vs; which (if wee bee once perſwaded, that there is any ſuch thing) eſteemes of eternall glorie in heauen, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt happineſs, that can bee obtained, or imagined. But what if the paines bee nothing, in compariſon of the courſes that wee would ſet our ſelues, to the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this honour: let vs ſee what they are, and then iudge.</p>
            <p>What is then required of vs, that wee may become the Sonnes of God? The holy Euangeliſt hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs, that <hi>Beleeuing in CHRIST,</hi> will make vs the Sonnes of <hi>GOD.</hi> What it it to beleeue in <hi>CHRIST?</hi> To truſt in him, or to reſt vppon him. For as we haue learned out of this twelfth verſe,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:21009:226"/> As many as receiue Chriſt, by beleeuing in his name, haue the Prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God. Can any man looke for, I will not ſay ſuch a Kingdome, but the leaſt kindneſs that may bee, vpon eaſier, or better conditions? <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> deſiring to be cured <note place="margin">2. King. 5. 10.</note> of his Leproſie, when he was willd by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> to goe waſh ſeuen times in <hi>Iordan,</hi> went away in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as if ſome hard matter had bin inioyned him. <hi>But his ſeruants</hi> (wiſer in that point then their maiſter) <hi>came, and ſpake vnto him, and ſaid; Father, if the Prophet had</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe. 11.</note> 
               <hi>commanded thee a great thing, wouldeſt thou not haue done it? How much rather then, when hee ſaith to thee,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe 13.</note> 
               <hi>waſh and bee cleane?</hi> The Noble man, conſidering that his ſeruants ſpake reaſon, followed the Prophets direction, and was healed. Healed of what? Of a Leproſie. By what meanes? By waſhing ſeuen times in <hi>Iordan.</hi> What is it, that wee deſire? To bee made the Sonnes of God. A farre greater matter, then to bee cured of a Leproſie. How may wee attaine to this honour? Beleeue, and thou ſhalt become the Sonne of God. Shall I need to compare theſe things together? Beleeue; Waſh. Which is ſooner done. Waſh ſeuen times. If thou beleeue once it ſufficeth. Not as if wee might bee the Sonnes of God, though wee ceaſe to beleeue; but becauſe he, that once true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſts on <hi>CHRIST,</hi> can neuer wholly depart from him. I ſee not how wee could deuiſe, to haue ſo great honour with ſo little paines; vnleſs perhaps we would attaine to it, by dreaming of it. Can wee i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine a readier courſe of preferment, or an eaſier la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in getting it, then to be made the ſonnes of God, by truſting in Chriſt? Doe but caſt thy care vpon him, &amp; thou ſhalt be ſure of that he promiſeth &amp; thou deſireſt.</p>
            <p>But it will not be amiſſe perhaps, conſidering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the matter, to examine theſe things more particularly; eſpecially in theſe two points: <hi>That belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:21009:226"/> is neceſſarily required to adoption; ſo that without the one, the other is not to be had, that the meanes of enioying heauen, which all men naturally propound to themſelues, are of greater paines, and leſſe (yea no) certainty:</hi> what if I ſay of meere impoſſibility? Suſpend your iudgement, till you haue heard, and vnderſtood the caſe: then giue ſentence freely, and ſpare not. Now for the better conceiuing of the matter, I will make bold to ſhewe the myſtery of our redemption, ſo much as is needfull, for the knowledge of that, wee haue in hande; but as ſhortly, as I can with plainneſs. It is not vnknown to any man, vnles he be vtterly ignorant of chriſtian Religion, that all mankind, and euery particular man, woman, &amp; child, loſt the fauour of God, and with it all hope, and poſſibility of happineſſe, by the tranſgreſſion of our firſt parents, in whome wee all ſinned. If any man bee deſirous to informe himſelfe better of this point, the Scripture is open for him: I will content my ſelfe, with that one teſtimony of the Apoſtle. <hi>By one man ſinne</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>came into the world, and death by ſinne: and ſo death went ouer all men, by him, in whome all men haue ſinned.</hi> For the recouery of this loſſe, it pleaſed God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a meanes of reconciliation, that his anger iuſtly conceiued againſt vs, might bee appeaſed, and wee receiu'd againe into his former fauour. This meanes was, <hi>his owne Sonne, in our nature, offered vp by himſelfe in ſacrifice, to God his Father. God was in Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the <note place="margin">2. Cor 5 19. Rom 5. 10.</note> Apoſtle) <hi>reconciling the world to himſelfe.</hi> And in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>when wee were enimies, wee were reconciled to God, by the death of his Sonne.</hi> But the manner of our reconciliation, on Chriſts part, doth not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the matter, we are now to handle. Let vs ſee what is required of vs.</p>
            <p>There are two things neceſſary to a ſound, and full reconciliation: that the offence, which cauſed the breach, bee pardoned, that the party offending bee
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:21009:227"/> admitted againe into as greate fauour, as hee was in, before he committed that fault. If either of theſe be wanting, the Reconciliation is vnperfect. Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt hath fully performed whatſoeuer was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, on his part, to procure abſolute Reconciliation. The Lord God is willing, and ready to bee reconciled vnto vs. Only the ſtay is in vs. For the pardon of ſinne, iuſtification is offered, <hi>not imputing of ſinne.</hi> And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 19.</note> wee were, before the breach, no otherwiſe in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, then ſeruants are, that pleaſe their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; now the Lorde is determined, to receiue vs, not as ſeruants, but as Sonnes by his free Adoption. <hi>God ſent his Sonne, &amp;c: that we might receiue the Adoption of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal 4. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Sonnes.</hi> Heere is full, and perfite reconciliation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided; <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> and <hi>Adoption.</hi> But how ſhall wee bee made partakers of it? <hi>I</hi> will leaue the former point, till I haue ſome fitter opportunity. Of the later our Euangeliſt ſpeakes in this place, teaching vs, that if wee beleeue in Chriſt, wee haue the prerogatiue to be Sonnes. This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confirmes: <hi>yee are al</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3, 26.</note> 
               <hi>the Sons of God, by faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt 2 ſuch witneſſes. No (ſaith one) if they agreed in their depoſitions. No (ſaith one) if they agreed in their depoſitions. But there is no ſmall difference betwixt them. The one ſaith wee haue that honor by beleeuing; the other affirms that fayth makes vs the Sons of God. The Euangeliſt requires the act: the Apoſtle contents himſelf with the vertue, grace or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemes to looke for no more, but that wee haue faith. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls preciſely for the vſe of it; <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, Beleeuing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this all the difference, that can bee found, in their teſtimonies? Then all is nothing. Firſt it is apparant (to begin withour Euangeliſt, whom we preſently expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> by enioyning vs <hi>To beleeue,</hi> neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires faith, by which we muſt beleeue: &amp; ſo his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition includes, &amp; implyes that, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:21009:227"/> Secondly, the Apoſtle, vnder the name of faith, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the act of beleeuing; which is neuer any more ſeuered from it, then burning is from fire. A greater fire burnes more, then a little one doth; but the leaſt, that can be, doth burne, as wel as the greateſt. So the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faith truſteth more firmely in Chriſt; but the weakeſt more or leſſe, relies truely vpon him. But that wee may ſee the ful agreement of theſe two witneſſes; let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the Apoſtle declares his owne meaning, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in the like matter. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 22. Chap. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>all, and vpon all that beleeue. Abraham beleeued God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> That Chapter is full of the like ſpeeches. So are his other Epiſtles, where he hath any occaſion to ſpeake of Iuſtification. And if that, which is former in nature, cannot bee had, but by beleeuing, ſurely this later, is not to be attain'd to, by the only hauing of faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as often as we find in Scripture, that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, Saluation,</hi> or any other ſuch fauour, &amp; bleſſing, is aſcribed to faith, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the act of faith, &amp; not the gift, or quality it ſelfe is ſignified. <hi>Wee Iewes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>who</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>knowe that a man is iuſtified by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, haue beleeued in Ieſus Chriſt, that wee might bee iuſtified by the faith of Chriſt.</hi> It is certaine, that <hi>Iuſtification</hi> is by ſaith; the Apoſtle ſhewes vs how. Namely by beleeuing in Chriſt. So muſt wee vnderſtand that, which the ſame Apoſtle hath in an other place: <hi>To him, that worketh not, but beleeueth in him, that iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Shall we ſay, that the habit of faith was counted for righteouſneſs? S. <hi>Paul</hi> had opened his meaning, touching that point, a verſe or 2 before; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe. 3.</note> 
               <hi>beleeued God, &amp; it was counted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> What was counted? His beleeuing, not his faith, as it was a grace, or vertue in his ſoule. We may the rather be perſwaded hereof, if wee call to minde, &amp; obſerue, both
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:21009:228"/> that our Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> alwaies vrgeth belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and not once mentions faith in ſo many places, where this matter is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, euen diuers times in ſome one Chapter; and alſo that our Lorde himſelfe, doth moſt commonly, in all the other Evangeliſts, follow the ſame courſe: and whereſoeuer hee giues any commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to faith, it is manifeſt hee doth it, in reſpect of the act thereof. <hi>I haue not found</hi> (ſaith hee of the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion) <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>ſo great faith in Iſraell.</hi> How greate faith? As to reſt vpon the very worde of Chriſt, for the curing of a ſick man, that was abſent. <hi>Speake the worde only</hi> (ſaith the Captaine) <hi>and my ſeruant ſhall bee healed.</hi> It woulde bee <note place="margin">Verſe. 8.</note> too long to ſtand vpon particulars; That one example may ſerue for all.</p>
            <p>It may bee, ſome man hearing, that fayth, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing breed ſuch wonderfull effects, will be deſirous to knowe how this may bee. What excelllency is there in faith, more then in other Chriſtian vertues? Why ſhould beleeuing in God bee preferred before louing of God? Firſt I muſt put you in minde; that it is the act of faith (as I haue often ſaid) by which theſe ſauours are obtained, and not the vertue it ſelfe. And therefore our Papiſts, who will haue their firſt iuſtification (as they mince matters) to conſiſt of faith, loue, &amp; charity, as they are vertues, habits, graces, qualities, beautifying and ſanctifying the ſoule, cannot reaſonably imagin, as they all commonly doe, that the Apoſtle in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Romans entreates of their iuſtification; becauſe he ſo often requireth the very act of beleeuing; which, in that iuſtification of theirs, hath no place: This being markt, and remembred, I ſay, that the act of fayth, or beleeuing, doth not bring iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and adoption, or either of them, by any ſpeciall excellency, that it hath in it ſelfe, but meerly &amp; only by the place, &amp; office, which the Lord, of his own will, &amp; mercy, hath aſſign'd it, to be the condition on our parts
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:21009:228"/> required, for the atchieuing of theſe fauours, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. The couenant of the law, ſtood in theſe tearmes, <hi>Hee that doth theſe things ſhall liue thereby.</hi> So that the <note place="margin">Leuit. 18. 5.</note> condition was righteouſneſſe, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act rule of the lawe. By the Goſpell, the Lord enters into a new couenant with man, the condition whereof <note place="margin">Act. 16. 31.</note> is, <hi>Beleeue, and thou ſhalt be ſaued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that, which the Apoſtle teacheth vs, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>the Lords accounting of faith for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the lawe, righteouſneſſe was neceſſarily required, that a man might haue an intereſt to heauen; now by the Goſpell. faith is accepted inſteed of righteouſnes. <hi>Do this:</hi> ſaith the law: <hi>Beleeue in Chriſt.</hi> ſaith the Goſpell. So that, when the queſtion is of reconciliation, and the parts thereof, or either of them, whether it be by faith, or no, the meaning is this, whether beleeuing bee the condition, which we are to performe, that wee may bee reconcil'd to God, or no. To this doubt the Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that <hi>Abraham beleeued God; &amp; it</hi> (that is) <hi>His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4 3. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>was</hi> counted to him for righteouſnes. Pardon me I pray you, if I doe but touch theſe things, or rather, but point at them, as I paſſe along. At ſome other times (if it pleaſe God) now one, then an other of them, ſhall bee cleered, and proued. Yet, for all my haſt, I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, to deliuer the ground of that, which I haue ſaid, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>the Lords accounting of faith for righteouſnes.</hi> I ſhew that the Apoſtle is ſo to be expounded, by 2 places of this ſame Epiſtle, where the very ſame maner of ſpeech is vſed. <hi>If the vncircumciſion</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) keepe the ordinances of the law, ſhall not his vncircumciſion bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>

               <hi>The children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> There is no other place in all the newe Teſtament, out of which wee maye learne the ſenſe of this phraſe;
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:21009:229"/> &amp; theſe two are plaine, being alike in themſelues, and agreeing with the Apoſtles wordes, and purpoſe in that other Text. What ſhould hinder vs then from expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Apoſtle, as we do? Or rather, with what reaſon can wee refuſe ſuch an interpretation, as the Apoſtle himſelfe points vs to? The waightineſſe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath carried mee farder then I meant to haue gone: I will bee the ſhorter in that, which remaines.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>faith</hi> then, or rather <hi>beleeuing,</hi> which the Lorde requires of vs, that we may become his children: not as if there were any excellency in the thing, or merit in the vſe of our freewill, for the worthineſſe whereof, ſuch a fauour, and honour ſhould be vouchſaf't vs: but onely, and meerely becauſe this is the courſe, by which the glory, &amp; riches of the mercy of God may bee declared. Therefore the Apoſtle concludes touching <hi>iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the former part of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> that it is, <hi>by faith with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out the workes of the law; becauſe thereby all boaſting is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27. 28</note> The Papiſts, that make their firſt iuſtification to be inherent righteouſneſſe, conſiſting of faith, hope, &amp; charity; their ſecond, actuall obedience to God, by the performance of the workes of the lawe, draw away the glory, and thanks from God, to themſelues. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I haue ſhewed, that they will haue the difference, whereby it comes to paſſe, that one man receiues iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace, and an other does not, To proceed from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans freewill, and not from any ſpeciall grace of God, inclining the ſoule to beleeue. Neither reſt they there; but hauing thus begun to magnify themſelues, by the getting of this grace, they go forward to rob God of his honour, &amp; thanks for our ſaluation; to that ende, they ſet out the dignity of that righteouſneſſe, whereof they make account, they are now poſſeſt; that Faith, Hope, &amp; Charity, ſo beautify their ſoules, that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but acknowledge them for his children, in whome he ſees ſo liuely, and perfect an image of himſelfe. This
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:21009:229"/> is the courſe, that Popiſh religion teacheth all men to follow, who are deſirous to be made the Sonns of God. If wee compare the meanes of attaining to this honor, which according to the Euangeliſts direction, wee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, with that courſe, which they preſent; I doubt not but we may truly ſay, that our faith, which is counted for righteouſnes, is more excellent, then their proud ſuppoſed righteouſnes ſo highly magnifyed by them.</p>
            <p>For ſeeing the maine ende of all religion, is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, by what ſhall we valew the excellency of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertue, or vertuous action rather, then by the more, or leſſe aduancing of that glory? And by what is, or can God be more glorifyed, in the ſaluation of man, then by our diſclayming, and renouncing of all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in our ſelues, and in all creatures, and reſting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him alone, as the only hope of al our happineſſe? By this, we acknowledge his ſufficiency to bee infinit, his kindneſſe to be incomparable. If we truſt to him for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, it is plaine we are throughly perſwaded, that hee hath power, and skill to deliuer vs. Wants he wiſdome, to diſcerne by what meanes our deliuerance muſt bee wrought? How ſhould we rely vpon him, that knows not whereby to helpe vs? Admit his skill were very great, in perceiuing what were to bee done for our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. What can that availe vs, if hee lack power to doe, or procure that to be done, which hee ſees wee ſtand in need of? Is it not a ſingular honour to God, to haue his wiſdome, and his power thus highly magnifyed? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon confeſſeth, it is beyond her reach.

What power is there in men, or Angells to procure this fauour?</p>
            <p>It is vnpoſſible to inforce him, that is almightie. And if he do it not willingly, as good not do it at all. For hee, that offers vnwillingly makes his offering of no valew. How then?

What haue we to giue, who our ſelues are <hi>not our owne?</hi> As if a bond-ſlaue, that hath nothing, <note place="margin">noſtri Iuris</note> but that, which is his maſters, ſhould redeeme himſelfe, with giuing ſome treaſure, which before he giues it, is his, to whom it muſt be giuen. What remaines then, but intreaty? To whom ſhall we ſue? What colour of reaſon ſhal we deuiſe, to ground our petition vpon? With what face ſhall we come into his preſence, to whom our very comming is odious? The neerer wee preſſe to him, the more we ſin. The greater our ſin is, the hotter is his wrath. The heauier his diſpleaſure is, the farder wee are from hope of fauour. What ſhal we but prouok him, by praying to him; incenſe him, by intreating him? As for making of any means to him, there is none in any place about him, but doth truly, &amp; worthily hate vs, as long as we continue in their Lords diſpleaſure. If we might haue acceſſe, durſt we, trowe you, preſume to approche vnto him?

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:21009:230"/> for mercy? The ſame conſcience of ſin, &amp; ſenſe of the wrath of God, would now alſo take from vs all heart to appeare before him, to make intreatie. But ſuppoſe we were admitted into his preſence, to offer vp our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. What ſhould wee ſay? How might wee begin to make ſo vnreaſonable a requeſt? Is there any man ſo voyde of ſenſe, as to thinke, that hee can perſwade a kinde father, to ſend his onely ſonne, ſo louing, ſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not onely to bee infinitly abaſed in his eſtate, but alſo to bee put to a moſt cruell and ſhamefull death, &amp; that for ſtrangers? Strangers, ſayd I? It were too much if wee were no more, but ſtrangers. What is it then to <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 6.</note> ſend him, for the behoofe of enemies; of rebels &amp; tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? Shall wee try, if wee can preuaile ſo much with the ſonne, as to become a ſacrifice for vs? The very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſſe of the ſuit makes me aſhamed to think on it: and is it poſſible we ſhould moue it? Would you intreat him to dye for you? O abſurd, and ridiculous motion! O ſenſeleſſe, and impious ſupplication!</p>
            <p>But I muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that the time paſſeth, &amp; ſtay my ſelf in the midſt of my race. It is enough, for the matter in hand, that wee vnderſtand what honour wee doo to God, by acknowledging his loue, his power, and his wiſedom, in reſting on him onely for ſaluation, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all the glorie, and thankes for it to his maieſty, and mercy. As for the Papiſts, that follow the other courſe, whereby they looke to make themſelues the ſonnes of God; though they pretend, I know not what extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie loue to him: yet in trueth, either they loue him not at all; or if they doe, it is becauſe they imagin, that hee lets them haue the cheefe glorie of their owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Seeme I to any man to ſpeake hardlier of them, then they deſerue? I appeale to the vnpartiall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any reaſonable man. Thus ſtands the caſe betwixt God, and them. Hee, of his owne mercy, hath prouided meanes, by which they may bee ſaued:
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:21009:231"/> but he hath taken no order, that they ſhall bee ſaued. If they will make vſe of this generall fauour, they may; if they will not, chooſe them. God hath as it were caſt his almes amongſt them: happy man bee his dole that ſeaſeth on them. If ſo, well; if not, ſo. He, for his part, could be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that euery man ſhuld lay hold on his offer of ſaluation. But hee leaues it to their owne choyſe, and ſittes by, looking on, to ſee who will, and who will not. If any man beleeue and bee ſaued, hee may thanke God, that hee might attaine to ſaluation; but that hee hath attained to it, hee may thanke himſelfe. Vnleſſe the meanes had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by God, hee could not poſſibly haue beene ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Though they were appointed, yet hee might haue been damned, if he had not helpt himſelfe, where God faild him. God, indeed gaue him ability to vſe the means and perhaps alſo perſwaded him to the vſe thereof: but ſtill hee left it wholly to his choyſe, whether hee would vſe them or no.</p>
            <p>So that if he think to challenge any man of vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he may iuſtly be aunſwered, that they doe him no wrong; as long as they aſcribe to him the poſſibilty of their being ſaued. There is a general thankfulnes due to him by all men; for that he furniſht them with ability to make choyſe of ſaluation. But for the particulars; euery man is much more beholden to himſelfe, then to God, if he come to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: That he might be ſaued (for I muſt repeatit again) he may thank God; that he is ſaued, hee may thanke himſelfe. Now on the contrary ſide, all the glorie of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redounds to God. We do nothing to ſaue our ſelues, but commit our ſelues, to God, to bee ſaued by him. The faith, wherby we reſt on him, is his meere gift. The vſe of that gift, is onely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his grace. He, Hee makes the difference betwixt beleeuers, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers: they that beleeue not, follow the choyſe of their owne wil. They that beleeue are not only perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:21009:231"/> but inclined thereto by the ſpirt of God; who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and (in reſpect of the euent) neceſſarily, brings them to beleeue; not making them beleeue, whether they will or no, but making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willing to beleeue. Thus it comes to paſſe, that the whole glory, and thankes for our ſaluation, are giuen to God, to whom only they are due: that we may not wonder, if God vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The principal ſcope of the Euangeliſt, as it is eaſie to diſcern, is to ſhew, that the ſonnes, of whome hee made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the former verſe, <hi>Are borne of God.</hi> This point hee amplifies by a deniall of the contrary: a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vſuall with our Sauiour Chriſt in his manner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as I noted before, and ſhall haue occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue <note place="margin">Ver. 3. 8.</note> ofter hereafter. <hi>Of God, not of man.</hi> The later point is farther inlarged, by denying them to bee bred of ſuch matter, as other ſonnes ordinarily are made of. <hi>Not of blood;</hi> or to haue man any way for the author of their being. <hi>Not of the will of the fleſh, nor of the</hi>

            <pb n="462" facs="tcp:21009:233"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Not of bloud.</hi> The purpoſe of the Euangeliſt, as I ſignified ere while, in theſe three Clauſes, is no more, but to teach vs, that the ſonnes, hee ſpake of, are not borne after any courſe of nature, or by any humane power, or meanes, but only of GOD. In this firſt point hee ſets out that doctrine, by denying, that they are made of ſuch matter, as all men conſiſt of. Bloud, as all Philoſophers, and Phyſitians affirme, is no part of the body; but only a nouriſhment, by which the whole, and euerie member of it, is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, and fed. The mouth receiues, and chewes the meate, then ſends it downe to the ſtomacke; from whence, after it is, as it were boyled, and concocted, it is put ouer to the Liuer. There it is turned into bloud; and in that nature, ſpread abroad from thence into all parts of the body; euerie one of which, by a proper, and admirable vertue giuen vnto it by God, changeth the bloud into its owne nature, and thereby receiues maintenance and growth. The like courſe is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by the prouidence of GOD, for the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our bodies; the matter, whereof they are made being principally bloud, as it hath beene certainely obſerued; the Liuer, which is the fountaine of bloud, beeing one of the firſt principall partes, that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>Much more might bee ſayde, and particularly touching our being made of bloud: but I thinke too little is better then too much of ſuch a matter, in ſuch a place, and Auditorie. Therefore alſo I will forbeare to propound ſome not very vnlikely coniectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reaſon, why the holy Ghoſt, in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, ſayeth <hi>blouds,</hi> rather then <hi>bloud. Not of blouds,</hi> ſayeth the Text. Why mentions the Euangeliſt <hi>blouds?</hi> I am willingly of their opinion, who take this for an <hi>Hebraiſme</hi> or a ſpeech framed orcording to the Hebrewe phraſe: in which it is vſuall, to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:21009:233"/> put <hi>blouds</hi> for <hi>bloud.</hi> A bloudy man, a bloudy Citie, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 7. 8. Pſal. 6. 7. &amp; 51. 16.</note> is with the Hebrewes, <hi>a man of blouds, a Cittie of blouds.</hi> But thoſe ſpeeches may well ſeeme to note a multitude <note place="margin">Ezech. 22. 2. Nahum. 3, 1.</note> of murders: Let vs propound ſome of another kind. <hi>If a theefe be found breaking vp, and ſmitten that hee die, no bloud ſhall bee ſhed for him.</hi> Worde for worde, <note place="margin">Exod. 22, 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>not bloudes for him.</hi> So in the next verſe. <hi>Blouds for him.</hi> It may bee the Euangeliſt, dooth the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name <hi>blouds,</hi> then <hi>bloud,</hi> becauſe hee ſpeakes of manye, and not of anie one. But let it heere ſuffice vs, that wee vnderſtande his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>In the next two clauſes, there is one worde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both; whereof I muſt needes ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, ere I enter into any particular examination of them. What is <hi>The will,</hi> which our Euangeliſt ſpeakes of? Is it (as ſome conceiue and teach, nothing elſe, but <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> or <hi>lust?</hi> I could bee content to thinke ſo, but that I neuer finde the worde in that ſenſe, in all the newe Teſtament. Once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the plurall number of it, is put for deſires, that are vnlawfull; <hi>Among whome</hi> (ſayeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>wee alſo had our conuerſation in times paſt,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>in the luſt of our fleſh, in fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh.</hi> But I doubt, whether this bee a ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to take it, in the ſingular number for <hi>luſt,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</hi> For the preſent, let vs retaine the word, <hi>will</hi> or <hi>deſire,</hi> and trie, what light wee may haue to diſcerne the meaning of it, by vnderſtanding the other two wordes, <hi>fleſh and man.</hi> By <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſome would haue the woman, or womankinde to bee meant. What one place of ſcripture can bee brought, where the worde is ſo vſed? For that in Geneſis, <hi>This is now fleſh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>of my fleſh;</hi> doth not prooue, that fleſh may ſignifie woman, anie more then that <hi>bone</hi> may; becauſe <hi>Eue</hi> is
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:21009:234"/> ſayde to be <hi>bone of</hi> Adams <hi>bone, as well as fleſh of his fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is out of queſtion, that our Euangeliſt would haue vs knowe, that the ſonnes of GOD, are not borne of women, any more then of men; but it is not likely, that hee intended to ſignifie ſo much by that worde: which is neuer vſed to that purpoſe, in any part, or place of Scripture. By <hi>fleſh</hi> then (as farre as I can yet conceiue) it is beſt to vnderſtand that, which is afterwarde expreſt; euen the nature of man, and woman. In this ſenſe the worde is common euerie where in Scripture. <hi>All fleſh had corrupted his way</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 12. Rom. 3, 20.</note> 
               <hi>vpon the earth. By the workes of the law ſhall no fleſh be iustified in his ſight.</hi> The Scripture is full of the like; as I preſume you all knowe. The reaſon of this is manifeſt. Fleſh by a double elegancy of ſpeech, is put for man: the matter, whereof the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, principally conſiſts, is <hi>fleſh;</hi> therefore by fleſh <note place="margin">Metonymia materiae. Synecdoche membri.</note> the body is ſignified. <hi>The bodie</hi> is one part of <hi>man:</hi> therefore by the body the whole man is vnderſtood. Thus fleſh comes to be taken for man. In this place we may vnderſtand by <hi>man,</hi> either <hi>Mankinde,</hi> or <hi>the Sexe,</hi> as man is diuers from woman. The Greeke worde may ſeeme to direct vs to the later, becauſe it dooth moſt commonly note the ſexe. Yet it may alſo, bee taken for both ſexes, as in theſe, and ſuch like places; <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whoſe vnrighteouſneſſe is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.</hi>

If our Euangeliſt had meant to haue ſpoken of man, by that kinde of ſpeech, hee woulde haue ſaid, <hi>which are borne, not of fleſh and bloud.</hi> May wee diuide thoſe former places? <hi>Fleſh hath not reuealed: Bloud hath not reuealed: Fleſh ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not inherit: Bloud cannot inherit.</hi> Theſe were marueilous ſtrange kinds of ſpeech, &amp; not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ble to the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt in Scripture. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoh I acknowledge that interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be true, for the generall ſenſe of it: yet I ſee not, how I may like of it, in the particulars; eſpecially ſeeing the holy Ghoſt vſeth a diuers manner of ſpeech in theſe 2 later, from the former. There hee ſaid no more, but <hi>Not of bloud;</hi> In the other, he denies alſo the will; or deſire: not of the will of the fleſh, not of the will of man.</p>
            <p>Let vs then, if you pleaſe, vnderſtand by bloud, the matter; by fleſh, the man, the efficient cauſe, and maker as it were; what ſhall wee ſay of the will of the fleſh, and man? Surely I will not grratly ſtriue with any man, who thinkes it ſhould be taken for concupiſcence: It is enough, that I propounded the reaſon of my doubt before. Giue mee leaue now to deliuer what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the matter; which is no more, but this, that I had rather vnderſtand by <hi>will, deſire,</hi> then <hi>luſt.</hi> What then ſhall bee the ſenſe of it? This, as I take it; that the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:21009:235"/> Euangeliſt giues vs to vnderſtand, that <hi>the Sonnes, of whom hee intreates, are not borne according to, or by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of man, which might procure or affect, or wiſh that kinde of Son-ſhip.</hi> How fitly this will agree with the ſcope of the place it ſhall appeare by and by, when I haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined that, which remaines.</p>
            <p>All, that wee haue ſaid hitherto, concerning this birth, is to ſhew, whence it is not. <hi>Not of bloud; not of man.</hi> VVhence is it then? <hi>Of God.</hi> God ſometimes notes the nature of the God head, ſometimes ſome one of the three perſons. How may wee moſt fitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, in this place? What if wee referre it to the <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 5. ſanlen. in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Euang. cap. 1.</note> holy Ghoſt, the ſpirit of whome euery man muſt bee borne, that ſhall enter into the kingdome of God? I doubt mee, wee ſhall hardly finde any one place of Scripture, where the worde <hi>God</hi> ſignifieth any ſeuerall perſon, but the Father. I deny not, that in ſome place, that is ſaid to be don by God, which in ſom other is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly aſcribed to the Sonne, or to the holy Ghoſt; but I ſay, that in thoſe places, where God is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the nature is to bee vnderſtood, nd not any one perſon.</p>
            <p>The compareing of theſe places together doth teach vs, that the Sonne, and the holy Goſt, are by nature God: but it doth not proue, that where God is named there either of theſe two perſons is ſpecially ſignified. Neither is it neceſſary to apply this to God the Father. but rather the oppoſition ſtandeth betwixt the diuine, &amp; humane nature, <hi>not of man:</hi> that is, not of man-kind, or of the nature of man; <hi>but of God,</hi> of the diuine nature, which is one, and the ſame in all three perſons.</p>
            <p>Thus haue wee the meaning of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, that <hi>the Sonnes hee ſpake of, ariſe not to that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by any power, or wiſedome of man, but meerely and only by the mighty worke of God himſelfe;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:21009:235"/> them to himſelfe, by the effectuall working of his ſpirit; and of his owne gratious fauour, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to adopt them for his Sonnes.</p>
            <p>I doe the rather make the ſenſe ſo large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I woulde not willingly omitte any thing, which, it may bee reaſonably preſumed, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt did, or might intende. For the cleerer vnderſtanding whereof, let vs cal to minde what was before deliuered, at the twelfth verſe: that there is a double <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> in reſpect of GOD; the former is that, whereof our LORD diſputes with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> by which wee are borne againe <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 35. &amp;c.</note> of the ſpirit, and fitted for the later, which is our <hi>Adoption</hi> by GGD the Father. The prerogatiue of being the Sonnes of GOD; is our being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, which is not vouchſaf't vs by GOD at the firſt, while wee are in our corrupt naturall eſtate; but then only beſtowed vpon vs, when by beleeuing wee are become one with IESVS CHRIST the naturall Sonne of GOD his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Sonne-ſhip</hi> is but a preparing of vs therevnto; by which that beleefe is begotten in vs, by the powerfull working of the holy Ghoſt, in the miniſtery of the worde. In this ſenſe the thirteenth verſe dependes thus vpon the laſt wordes of the twelfth. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had ſaid, that they become the Sonnes of GOD, which beleeue in the name of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Hee proceedes to ſhewe how they attaine to this beleefe: By being borne not of bloud &amp;c: but of God. They haue it not by nature in their birth, they get it not by any naturall deſire, or will: but they are borne anew of God, and haue it by him fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and formed in them.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of both theſe points is moſt true; the wordes will beare them both: they will both ſtande
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:21009:236"/> with the ſcope of the place, and purpoſe of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt; <note place="margin">Chryloſt. in Io. homil. 9. The oph. ad hune locum.</note> that I am not afraid of doing any wrong to the Text, though I make ſo large an interpretation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Let vs then, in the feare of God, handle theſe things ſome what particularly, but ſhortly, as the time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. What a prerogatiue it is, for men to bee the Sonnes of God, wee heard in the laſt exerciſe; here the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt farder ſets foorth the excellency thereof, by ſhewing the baſeneſſe of our naturall birth: which for the matter of it, is bloud; for the making, at the beſt, but humane; whereas the other is wholly, and only from God. I will not amplify the former point tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our naturall birth, as I might doe: but only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you to the conſideration of it, by your ſelues. For your better direction wherein, I will name two <note place="margin">Iob. 10. 9. 10. 11. Ezech. 16. 4. 6.</note> places of Scripture, which I commende to your humble, and diligent meditation. In the former, the naturall breeding of man-kind is purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: in the later his birth is ſhewed; by way of allegory, if wee conſider the intent of the holy Ghoſt; but plainely, and truly, if wee reſpect the matter it ſelfe. Reade them both at your leaſure; and I make no doubt, but you will bee aſhamed to thinke, that beeing ſo meanely bred, and brought foorth (I ſpeake as fauourably as I can) wee ſhould bee ſo ſtrangely proud, and inſolent, as for the moſt part wee are.</p>
            <p>VVeake and baſe is our naturall beginning: migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glorious is our ſpirituall adoption. By that, wee are borne the Sonnes of men: by this, wee are choſen the Sonnes of God. In our firſt condition, wee are brought foorth to all kinde of miſery: in our ſecond eſtate, wee are aduaunced to true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The one caſts vs naked, and forlorne, vpon the bare earth: the other lifts vs vp, from earth to heauen: That brings vs out of priſon to puniſhment: this
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:21009:236"/> leades vs from paine to pleaſure: with our conception begins our mortality, our adoption giues vs entrance into immortality; And doe we for all this, ſtand doating, vpon our naturall eſtate?</p>
            <p>Are wee proud of that, of which wee may rather bee aſhamed? What art thou, that beareſt thy ſelfe ſo high? A Gentleman? A Nobleman? A Prince? Heyre apparant to the Empire of the whole earth? Bee it ſo: yet was thy breeding, and bearing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiell</hi> deſcribe. The pooreſt, and baſeſt wretche, that goeth on the ground, had the ſame manner of beginning, and being. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy ſelfe: as thy death ſhall bee like his, duſt to duſt; ſo was thy birth like to his, bloud of bloud, fleſh of fleſh. Thou art the ſonne of an Emperor. Yet of a man. Be not deceiued; thy nature is no better then his; though thy eares, and ſorrowes may proue more, and greater.</p>
            <p>A gentleman, a nobleman, a King, are not names of diuers natures, but of diuers troubles. Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adoption is that, which makes difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Humane, and Diuine; <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abell,</hi> were both <hi>Adams</hi> ſonnes: <hi>Iſmaell</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Abrahams:</hi> All foure were borne a-like <hi>of bloud, of the will of the fleſh, of the will of man.</hi> But <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> were adopted the ſonnes of GOD: <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Iſmaell</hi> were neuer any more, but the ſonnes of men.</p>
            <p>Looke how much God is more excellent, then man: ſo much more glorious is it to bee the ſonne of God, then of man. Looke how much the ſpirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes the fleſh; ſo much better is it, to bee borne of the ſpirit, then of the fleſh. If thou bee the adopted ſonne of God, by grace; it skils not whoſe ſonne thou art by nature.</p>
            <pb n="470" facs="tcp:21009:237"/>
            <p>Beleeue in Chriſt, and thou haſt the prerogatiue to bee the ſonne of GOD. Neuer tell mee, how meane and poore thy parents were. Neuer boaſt how rich, and noble they were. Bloud, and fleſh, &amp; man muſt hinder either all, or none at all. For in all theſe, all are equall.</p>
            <p>How meane ſoeuer thy bloud be, it is bloud; How noble ſoeuer it bee, it is but bloud. Thy nobilitie helpes not, thy baſeneſſe hinders not thy adoption. <hi>Not of bloud, not of fleſh, not of man, but of God.</hi> God needes no ſuch time, and meanes, for adoption, as thy naturall parents neede for procreation. There is no ſtay, but in thy ſelfe. Thou ſhalt no ſooner beleeue in the name of Chriſt, but preſently God will accept thee for his ſonne. Is ſo excellent an eſtate, ſo eaſilie to be come by; and doo wee refuſe, or delay to vſe the meanes? Surely there needes no other proofe, that our ſecond birth of regeneration, is not <hi>of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God;</hi> then that ſo fewe are ſo borne againe.</p>
            <p>I am come now to the laſt poynt of this Text, and exerciſe: which I will runne ouer verie briefely. The prerogatiue to bee the ſonnes of God, belonges to them onely that receiue our Sauiour Chriſt; by beleeuing in him. Who are they, that doe ſo receiue him? They that are borne of GOD. What is it to bee borne of GOD? To haue our vnderſtanding inlightned with the knowledge of the Goſpell, our hearts inclined to embrace it; ſo that wee wholly renounce our ſelues, all truſt in our owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, all good opinion thereof, and reſt onely vpon Ieſus Chriſt to bee reconciled to GOD by him. This eſtate, as our Euangeliſt teacheth vs in this place, is not attained to by any power, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of man; but by the mighty working of GOD, <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 10.</note> who creates (as the Prophet ſayeth) <hi>new hearts in</hi>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:21009:237"/> 
               <hi>vs,</hi> changing ſtone into fleſh; <hi>taking our stonie hearts</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezech. 11. 19. Cap. 36. 26.</note> 
               <hi>out of our bodies, and giuing vs hearts of fleſh.</hi> For the naturall man (take him at the beſt, with all the helpes, that nature, learning, and education canne afforde, is (notwithſtanding all theſe) vnable to acknowledge or like of the meanes, which God in his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath appointed for our ſaluation. The holy Ghoſt giues vs the reaſon of it. For (ſayeth hee by the penne of Saint <hi>Paul) they are fooliſhneſſe vnto</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>him, and cannot bee diſcerned, but by the ſpirit;</hi> which no man can haue, but by a ſecond birth from GOD. I cannot ſtand to inlarge this point by many proofes; neither is it greatly needfull: becauſe it hath beene done already in my former exerciſes, and ſhall be done hereafter, if it pleaſe God, as occaſion ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>Yet I may not at any hand forget, becauſe it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially concernes the glory of God, the ende of all true religion, to call to your remembrance, what hath formerly beene deliuered, touching the worke of God, in bringing men to beleeue in Chriſt. The ſumme of it is this, that it is God, which makes vs both able, and willing to beleeue, not waiting for the choyſe of our freewill, which, like a free horſe, runnes headlong to infidelitie; but gratiouſly, and powerfully inclining vs to beleeue. Dooſt thou then beleeue in Chriſt to ſaluation, whereas many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that haue had the ſame worde, outwardly by the miniſterie of men, and the ſame grace inwardly by the motion of the ſpirit offered to them, continue in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe? Take heede thou doe not imagine, that this difference proceeded from thy ſelfe. That they doe not beleeue, it is by their owne fault. That thou doeſt beleeue, it is by not by thine owne vertue. Noe, ſayeſt thou. I knowe that and confeſſe it. I ſtood in need of the grace of GOD, as well as other men; I was
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:21009:238"/> not able to bee ſaued without it, nor to procure it. GOD, of his owne goodneſſe, found out the meanes, prouided them, gaue mee knowledge of them, inabled mee to embrace them. All this I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly aſcribe to God. Is this all, thou giueſt him? ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, at the leaſt as thou perſwadeſt thy ſelfe, haue been equall to thee, in all theſe fauours from God, who yet neuer attained to beleefe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I would faine knowe of thee, how this difference grewe, that thou beleeueſt, and they doe not. They would not, and I would. Thou ſayeſt well: For indeede noe man euer beleeues, but willingly. Yet this doth not ſatisfie my doubt. I demaund farther, how came it to paſſe, that thou wouldeſt, and they would not. Doe not aunſwere mee; Becauſe I would. For if that bee all, thou canſt ſay, thou doeſt rather condemne thy folly, then commend thy obedience in yeelding. I ſawe it was the onely courſe, I coulde take for my ſaluation. Did not thoſe other, which beleeue not, ſee that too, as well as thou? Elſe the difference proceeded not, from the choyſe of thy will, but from the cleereneſſe of thy iudgement. I graunt, they ſawe as much as I, but they did not like it, as well as I. Wee are neuer a whit the neerer, for all this conference. I aske ſtill, howe thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to haue a better liking of it, then they had. I vſed the freedome of my will, better then they did. I perceiue then, when all comes to all, the difference muſt ariſe from free well. But our Euangeliſt ſayeth, <hi>Not of the will of man.</hi> Otherwiſe there <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 27.</note> were verie iuſt, and great cauſe in men of boaſting, and ſmall glorie, or thankes due to God, euerie man being the principall cauſe of his owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as I haue ſhewed heeretofore, thus might anie man that beleeues, reaſon with GOD; Why ſhould I bee challenged of vnthankefulneſſe? <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
